      "Ariana Grande's donut-licking cost her a gig at White House, WikiLeaks reveals Licking donuts and saying “I hate America” cost Ariana Grande a prime gig performing for Barack Obama at the White House gala last September, according to several email exchanges exposed by WikiLeaks. Amid the thousands of DNC emails posted by WikiLeaks on Friday was a 10 September 2015 response to a request from the DNC finance chair, Zachary Allen, to vet the former Nickelodeon star to perform at a gala for the US president. “Ariana Butera-video caught her licking other peoples’ donuts while saying she hates America,” the DNC’s deputy compliance director wrote in response, referring to Grande’s real name. “Republican Congressman used this video and said it was a double standard that liberals were not upset with her like they are with Trump who criticized Mexicans; cursed out a person on Twitter after that person used an offensive word towards her brother.” A few months before the email exchange, on 4 July, Grande was caught on security cameras (obtained by TMZ) licking donuts sitting on the top shelf at a donut shop in southern California. When offered a fresh tray of donuts by an employee of the store, Grande is heard saying: “What the fuck is that? I hate Americans. I hate America.” The event caused the hashtag #DonutGate to quickly go viral. Though never charged by police, the pop star issued a public apology on YouTube, in which she said: “I’ve actually never been prouder to be American.” Grande is meanwhile one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest celebrity endorsers: in April 2015 she tweeted a short and succinct message to her millions of followers that expressed her sentiment. This piece was amended on 26 July 2016; Ariana Grande was a child star on Nickelodeon, not the Disney Channel.\n",
      "Never mind John Lewis – here's the TV advert music it's impossible to forget One of pop’s biggest days of the year fell last Thursday, when John Lewis unveiled its Christmas ad. The soundtrack to that ad is considered one of the prime showcase slots in the music industry – as Eamonn Forde wrote in the in 2014: “Winning the ad is the holy grail for sync departments and the pitching process is as long as it is secretive, with all entrants silenced by hefty non-disclosure agreements.” Yet so often the song that accompanies the ad, despite being inescapable for six weeks, is gone from our minds like melting snow in January (can anyone remember a single thing about Tom Odell’s version of Real Love in 2014?). But the music of adverts need not be like that: the adverts we remember might be accompanied by music we hate, but there is no danger of us ever forgetting them. These are the advert themes we can’t shake (or vac). What are yours? Rowntree’s Tots I’d love to tell you that my earliest memories are of some wonderful family holiday, or of the verdant loveliness of a childhood in the Yorkshire Dales. But I can’t: every last one of my earliest memories involves television. They start to crowd in from around the time I was three or four: Wizzard on Top of the Pops (I was terrified of Roy Wood), Robert Wyatt on Top of the Pops (I was intrigued by his wheelchair), the cartoon polar bear who shilled Cresta pop with the words “It’s frothy, man”, and the song from an advert for Rowntree’s Tots. I can’t remember the visuals that accompanied it at all, but a snatch of the melody and the lyrics inexplicably clung to me forever afterwards: “Candy Tots, something new / They’re dolly mixtures and soft to chew.” It would, in the way of ad music, pop into my head unbidden at inexplicable moments, until the day in the mid-noughties when I was sent a compilation of the work of late 60s/early 70s pop journeyman John Carter, variously the lead singer of the New Vaudeville Jazz Band, the brains behind First Class’s fantastic Brian Wilson homage Beach Baby, and the co-author of Summer of Love cash-in Let’s Go to San Francisco by the Flowerpot Men. I was only half-listening to it (as you might expect, given his CV, the musical quality was a bit variable) when the Rowntree’s Tots advert came bursting from the speakers: it transpired Mr Carter knocked out advertising jingles as well, and Rowntree’s Tots had been such a success that a spin-off single with altered lyrics was released. A little pathetically, I literally shouted in excitement. It would be nice if I could tell you the song was great, but, alas, 30 years on, it sounded a bit twee and irritating. Moreover, hearing it again didn’t – as I hoped - expunge it from my mind. It’s still rattling around in there, and I fully expect to be plagued by a jaunty endorsement of the manifold qualities of Candy Tots (long discontinued) on my deathbed. Alexis Petridis Shake n’ Vac Ever since I first heard it as a schoolboy in the early 1980s, the irritatingly catchy Shake n’ Vac ad song has lodged in my poor brain like a virus, and despite not being on TV since 1989, it still pops into my head. A retro, 50s-style rock’n’roll backing accompanies the brutally effective jingle: “Do the Shake n’ Vac and put the freshness back / Do the Shake n’ Vac and put the freshness back / When your carpet smells fresh, your room does too …” Argh, no! The advert itself now looks kitsch and dated: Jenny Logan plays a maxi-skirted, high-heeled, bottom-wiggling housewife who sings of the joys of a sinister white powder that resembles anthrax, which is sprinkled over a carpet and vacuumed up again to leave it sparkling clean. I’ve since resisted the tune’s demonic calling and marketing witchcraft in the only way I know, by installing laminate flooring. Dave Simpson Carphone Warehouse Poor old Stereo MC’s. Their legacy as British hip-hop pioneers, whose 1990 single Elevate My Mind was the first UK rap entry on the US Billboard 100, will forever be eclipsed by four little words: gonna get myself connected. Yes, the London four-piece were indeed the band who soundtracked those Carphone Warehouse ads with a funk loop nabbed from KC and The Sunshine band affiliate Jimmy “Bo” Horne and some sub-Britpop swagger. Like Mansun and soul patches, Connected is a thing of pure Nineties naffness – not quite dance but not quite indie, despite frontman Rob Birch showcasing a meandering, karaoke Tim Burgess vocal style. Although this writer was born two months after its release, its role in the marketing of 10-tonne Motorolas during my formative years means that – pardon the pun – I shall forever feel a connection. Hannah J Davies Milky Way “The red car and the blue car had a race.” Those words alone are enough to set a piece of music racing through the heads of TV viewers of a certain age – the music to the ad known as Red Car Blue Car, made for Milky Way in 1989, a tinny piece of country rock’n’roll written by Mike Connaris, and a song so infernally catchy that when the ad was revived in 2009, there were people who celebrated its return. Even more incredibly, when its lyrics were changed and the song re-recorded as Home for Christmas Day, it reached No 44 in the charts – in December 1991. Yes, even after two years of exposure to the ad, there were people who were not yet sick of it. (These, perhaps, were the same people who decided they needed to buy a copy of Brian May’s Ford advert, Driven by You. Or who cheered when John Farnham performed his Gillette razors track The Best in concert.) But Red Car Blue Car did its job. To this day, when I see a red car and blue car next to each other at traffic lights, I wonder if they’ll race, and if the red car will be able to do anything but stuff its face. Like “apples, hazelnuts, bananas, raisins, coconuts, sultanas” and “feed me! Feed me NOW!”, Red Car Blue Car is now embedded deep within me. It doesn’t make me want to eat Milky Ways, though. Michael Hann Müller yogurt Yoghurt advertising is irritating enough as it is: whether it’s Nicole Scherzinger orgasming over a fruit corner or some French children being intolerably wholesome in the vicinity of a Petits Filous, the flogging of the stuff is a small universe of ridiculous commercial fiction. But maybe the industry’s biggest crime was to take the transcendent 1968 Nina Simone song Ain’t Got No, I Got Life, layer some cow sound effects over it, and turn it into a maddening earworm most closely associated with imbecillic milk-based joie de vivre. Another unfortunate side-effect of using it to soundtrack a series of farm vistas is that it makes you realise how much Simone’s voice resembles a sheep’s. And thus, an icon now exists as little more in my mind than bleating shorthand for a worryingly fanatical devotion to dairy products. Rachel Aroesti Huggies Pull-Ups Morrissey once sang: “The music that they constantly play / It says nothing to me about my life.” That has long been the case for me and the song from the Huggies Pull-Ups advert, which has been constantly playing in my head now for at least two decades despite saying precious little about my life. A quick Google suggests it first seeped into my consciousness when I was barely a teenager. And yet, despite being free of the need to consider elasticated nappy/pant hybrids by, ooh, at least a year or so, the song has remained stitched to my eardrums like some kind of audio Celtic symbol. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most annoying jingles ever recorded. The lyrics are annoying, the tune is moronic and the kid’s voice instilled in me a deep loathing of all human beings under the age of five. And yet I’ve never felt truly free of its presence. Indeed, if its influence over my daily soundtrack had finally started to wane in recent years, then the arrival of my daughter this summer meant that it has since returned with a vengeance. Of course, now that I’m in a situation where I might actually need to buy “big kid pants”, you could argue that the Huggies advert finally does say something to me about my life. And does that make it any less annoying? No. No it does not. Tim Jonze\n",
      "Live music booking now Judging by Bad Habits, the first track to be released from second album Everything You’ve Come To Expect (out 1 April), Alex Turner and Miles Kane’s sort-of supergroup The Last Shadow Puppets are headed in an increasingly noirish, garage rock-based direction (perhaps in an effort to tie in with Turner’s sartorial leanings). They’re also heading out on tour for the first time since 2008 (26 Mar to 3 Apr, tour starts Usher Hall, Edinburgh) … More names have been revealed for this summer’s Reading and Leeds festivals. Alongside previously announced main stagers the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Disclosure and Foals will rotate headline duties on one of the other evenings; the mainly teen audience will also be treated to a set from author of crack-manufacturing anthems Fetty Wap (Richfield Avenue, Reading & Bramham Park, Leeds, 26 to 28 Aug) … In further festival news, Green Man has Belle And Sebastian, James Blake and Wild Beasts topping its bill (Glanusk Park, nr Crickhowell, 18 to 21 Aug) … While east London’s Lovebox plays host to LCD Soundsystem and Major Lazer (Victoria Park, E3, 15 & 16 Jul).\n",
      "When I got my Top of the Pops break, Mum got me new pyjamas My father was sitting by the fire, with a transistor radio in his lap. At the age of 57, Don Bradley was listening to John Peel for the first time in his life. His new found interest in Radio 1’s finest was sparked by his son’s band making a record that immediately fell under the patronage of Peel. It was 1978. The Undertones had recorded Teenage Kicks that summer. It was a big deal for us, still playing every weekend in a bar in Derry and finally achieving what few of our fellow citizens had ever done. Making a single (an EP, no less) and getting it reviewed in the NME and played on national radio. Not that I made a big deal of it at home. The ninth of 11 children, I realised early on that you were allowed to go ahead and do what you wanted, as long as it didn’t cost money and was unlikely to land you in hospital or in prison. My parents were not liberal bohemians, though. Don and May Bradley were strict practising Catholics, which could account for my having 10 siblings. Mass on a Sunday, fish on a Friday, television switched off during Holy Week. No rules about punk rock, though. The only advice my mother gave me when I started to hang around with friends who would become the Undertones was to stop slouching. I was a couple of inches taller than Billy, John and Vincent and she said, in a not unkind way, that I was starting to stoop. A subconscious effort to blend in. She was also the first to say to me that long hair was on the way out. This was early 1976 and I suspect it was a ploy to get my shoulder-length mop into some kind of order, rather than a premonition of future trends. My father was an accordion player (button key, harder to learn than the piano key version) who played with a local ceili band. Fifteen years before Teenage Kicks, Charlie Kelly’s Ceili Band made the occasional appearance on BBC TV and I remember being allowed to get out of bed and come downstairs to the front room when they were on screen. Even with the aerial held just so, I found it hard to pick him out, especially as he wore a bow tie and a white shirt. He never wore the bow tie when he was going to work as a storeman at a local farm supplies co-op. It was hard work, especially on the mornings after a late night ceili in some far flung corner of Ireland. But he did it without complaint or talk of television studios. When it came to my turn in music, I took that attitude from him. Maybe too much. I never officially told him or my mother that I was in a band called the Undertones. One morning I did say that someone from Sire Records in London was coming over to see us play. Not in a conversation, though. I just said it out loud and hoped that someone would pick it up in the middle of everything else that was happening at home. Dinners, cleaning, worrying about money. It was noted, though. When I got the word the band were appearing on Top of the Pops, my mother did her bit by buying me a new set of pyjamas. No words of warning about London, about behaving myself or about signing my life away. None were needed. Although she did introduce me to the phrase “living in each others’ pockets”, which made sense when we broke up five years later. A couple of decades on and my 18-year-old son is playing jazz on the drums in our front room. He’s very good, although he stops as soon as I open the door. “Very good,” I volunteer, although I’m really there to let him know that his dinner is on the table.

      "From Afar review – compelling film-making This assured first feature from Venezuelan director Lorenzo Vigas is a masterclass in storytelling through image rather than words. The photography, particularly the eloquent use of shallow focus and the eye for subtle body language, delivers stabs of clarity to a portrait of an ambiguous relationship between a man in his 50s and the teenage gang leader he meets on the streets. Armando (played by the great Chilean actor Alfredo Castro, a regular collaborator of Pablo Larraín) is coolly inscrutable, the bitterness resulting from some hinted-at childhood trauma etched deep into his watchful face. He is gay but prefers his sexual encounters, like everything else in his life, at a safe distance. He scopes the streets of Caracas for young men, takes them back to the shadowy secrets of his apartment, but never touches them. One day he spots Elder (Luis Silva). The teenager lashes out, both with homophobic invective and with his fists, but there’s an uneasy fascination between the mismatched couple which draws them together. When I first saw this picture at the Venice film festival, where it won the top prize, I felt that it suffered in comparison to the similarly themed Eastern Boys (2013) by Robin Campillo. On a second viewing, however, while it lacks the propulsive narrative drive and tonal shifts of Eastern Boys, From Afar reveals itself to be every bit as compelling a piece of film-making.\n",
      "Noel Gallagher: We should never have made Be Here Now then Oasis should never have made Be Here Now when they did, according to Noel Gallagher. Despite being bullish around the time of its release, the Oasis songwriter now claims that the band’s overblown 1997 album was recorded too soon after their hugely successful second LP What’s the Story (Morning Glory)? During a video interview with Vevo, Gallagher said: “I only say this now, looking back on it after 20 years … we should never have made that record then. We came off the back of that American tour which was, again, the third tour in a row that we never completed. And I came back to the airport and the fucking world’s press was there and instead of going, ‘Right, we should just go our separate ways for a year or two,’ we decided like idiots to go straight into the studio.” He added: “That maybe wasn’t the best idea. Morning Glory hadn’t really run its course then. It was probably still number one in England, it was definitely still top five in the States. And yet, there we were, going into the studio, effectively trying to make another album to kill it, which was ridiculous.” Gallagher also claimed that the band should have been talked out of making the record when they did. He said: “I often think, looking back, the people around us who were in the music business for 20 years before we got there should really have said something.” Be Here Now received rave reviews at the time of its release, and saw fans queuing outside record shops to buy it. But it has since gained a reputation as being an act of cocaine-addled folly, full of overlong songs and nonsensical lyrics. A remastered reissue of the album is out now.\n",
      "The 50 best films of 2016 in the US: No 2 Toni Erdmann Few people settle in for a three-hour German comedy about an uptight woman and her farty father expecting a masterpiece. Yet that’s what Maren Ade’s extraordinary, genre-bending revolution of a movie is. It tells of Ines (Sandra Hüller), an efficient, humourless, whippet-thin businesswoman in her mid-30s. She’s focused on success with no apparent aim but for its own sake (“You’re an animal,” someone tells her – there are a lot beasties in this film). To this end, she sacrifices her free time, much of her social life, and many of her ethics. There’s one appalling scene in which she must take shopping the wife of a powerful contact she’s courting. “I’m not a feminist,” she witheringly tells one of the colleagues above whom she is miles more capable and bright, “or I wouldn’t tolerate guys like you.” We pity brittle Ines. We don’t necessarily like her. Following the death of his dog, her prank-loving dad, Winfried (Peter Simonichek), decides to pay her a visit for the weekend. This goes appallingly; the endless wait for the lift down from her apartment to the cab is a perfect horror-show of two people with deep affection who can’t stand the sight one another. But Winfried, concerned for Ines’s sanity, does not actually leave. Rather, he shows up again, infiltrating her sacred professional circle, beneath weird wig and ill-fitting false teeth, calling himself a life coach called Toni Erdmann. Similarities to Les Patterson are accidental – but irresistible. Toni also bears a striking resemblance to Harold Bornstein, aka Donald Trump’s trusted doctor (on the left in this Twitter comparison). The remainder of the film is essentially a compendium of showcase scenes which you can’t shift, even months on. There’s an Easter egg painting party which culminates in an angry, flabbergasting rendition of Whitney Houston’s The Greatest Love of All (which had the Cannes press audience erupting in spontaneous, mid-screening applause). There’s the naked birthday bash. The sex scene involving petits fours. The shockingly moving playground chase involving a Kukeri (like an elephant, they’re hard to describe, but you know one once you’ve seen one). Ade’s film, highly scripted but culled from hundreds of hours of footage, is like nothing you’ve ever seen before. It tickles, frequently, but it also touches you more deeply than you could have anticipated. It is an extravagant film about loneliness and DNA, its web of emotional hostage-taking too complex to ever begin to unpick.\n",
      "It’s only rock’n’roll, Labour, but you should like it There is a newspaper Xanadu where some of the ’s greatest journalistic triumphs reside. These include one of the greatest scoops in the history of UK print journalism when, in 1812, reporter Vincent George Dowling was on hand to witness the assassination of the prime minister, Spencer Perceval, before stepping in to apprehend the killer. A century or so later, in 1919, JL Garvin penned his famous and prescient editorial on the Treaty of Versailles: “The Treaty left the Germans no real hope except in revenge.” The paper’s legacy of seeing what others refused to see and uttering what others feared to utter was evident once more in 1956 during the Suez crisis. The took a principled stand of the government’s conduct on the issue. “We had not realised that our Government was capable of such folly and such crookedness,” our leader writer then wrote. I also feel the ’s spirit of fearlessness digging at the coalface of truth inspired our campaign to restore authentic rock music to the airwaves of Scotland. In April 2014, I was shocked to learn that Scotland’s only proper rock radio station had been replaced by something vapid and inane called X-FM. I wrote then: “Heavy rock is important to society as it portrays and recalls our industrial heritage and celebrates hard work, honesty and integrity. If there was ever a proper revolution in this country it would provide the soundtrack to the social upheaval; not Franz Ferdinand or the Smiths or Blur.” It seems our campaign has paid off. For it was announced last month that Ofcom had awarded Rock Radio Glasgow the FM commercial radio licence in the west central Scotland area. It was the culmination of a campaign that, I think, stands within the finest traditions of the ’s brave and counterintuitive reporting. Donald MacLeod, who owns the Cathouse and Garage nightclubs, is chair of Rock Radio. He is a chap not unknown to the in Scotland as he has often offered us sanctuary in one of his meaty establishments when many others had previously refused. MacLeod was effusive in his appreciation of the for its support. “If it hadn’t been for the unstinting support of the , I’m not sure we would have got over the finishing line. As Jimmy Page and Robert Plant once wrote: ‘And it’s whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reason’.” Scotland has been buffeted recently by fell forces that still threaten its economic and social wellbeing. The independence referendum was lost in a welter of falsehoods and half-truths whereby Labour in Scotland and their allies in the Tory party conned the frail and the elderly into maintaining the status quo. Since then we’ve had Brexit, the rise of the hard right, ultra-austerity, racial aggravation and the bitter knowledge that Donald Trump is Scottish. Yet there are signs that the nation is experiencing a degree of solace in a rock’n’roll renaissance. The news that Rock Radio now possesses the new FM licence in the west of Scotland doesn’t just mean a return to Led Zep, Deep Purple, Van Halen, Mountain and Judas Priest and an escape from Adele, Justin Bieber and Rhianna. It will also provide training and support for indigenous bands who acknowledge that God has indeed given rock’n’roll to us, to paraphrase those great lyricists Simmons and Stanley. This year also marked the 10th annual Bonfest in Kirriemuir, held to celebrate the life and career of Bon Scott, celebrated frontman of AC/DC, who was raised in this douce little Angus town. Previously, Kirriemuir was known only as the birthplace of JM Barrie. Now, thanks to Bonfest, it’s been revealed that for the first time more people were inspired to visit Kirriemuir because of its Bon Scott connection than its JM Barrie one. And let’s face it, what would you rather your town was renowned for: fairies or rock’n’roll damnation? Next year’s Bonfest will be held in April and, while Scotland has far too many arts and cultural festivals, this one shouldn’t be missed. The majority of festivals are principally for a wandering troupe of second-rate authors, singers and artists who can’t make money on their own but can live off the fees guaranteed by gullible local councils that think they’re funding something cultural and essential. Inexplicably, Glasgow, which has a rich rock’n’roll heritage, has opted to turn up its nose at the chance to market itself as one of the world’s top destinations for the head-banging oeuvre. Although Bon Scott was the braggartly leader of AC/DC, the band were founded by the Glaswegian brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, who were born within sight of the water tower at Cranhill in the East End of Glasgow. Yet, despite the efforts of councillor Frank Docherty, the ruling Labour group decided against awarding these two the freedom of the city. The party was probably too busy doing what it does best: making twinning arrangements with enough cities to keep its councillors in jollies for a lifetime. If Labour wants to have a chance of holding off the SNP’s assault on its local authority powerbase in Glasgow, it needs to get with the rock’n’roll picture. If the SNP get in they’ll probably ban all rock’n’roll because the lyrics are not sufficiently diverse and fail to deliver the appropriate pattern of deliverable outcomes on gender issues and responsible attitudes towards alcohol and relationships. So here’s my plan to help Labour stave off the threat of the Nationalist roundheads. They need to announce a Rockfest week along the lines of Kirriemuir’s Bonfest. This would celebrate the genius of the Young brothers and others such as Brian Robertson, the great Thin Lizzy lead guitarist, Alex Harvey, Jimmy Barnes, Bobby Gillespie and Jim Kerr. In their seminal work, Sin City, a thoughtful étude on loss and redemption in an urban setting, Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott included these lines: So spin that wheel, cut that pack And roll those loaded dice Bring on the dancing girls And put the champagne on ice I’m goin’ in To Sin City\n",
      "Depp and Heard's biosecurity thriller ends in lo-fi hostage video – review Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp has delivered a startling fall-from-grace character portrait in the final act of the legal/biosecurity thriller nobody expected: one part intrepid dog movie and two parts international relations drama, like The International by way of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, with a dash of Midnight Express thrown in. The pulse-pounding first act starts with a clock-is-ticking twist, harking back to Depp’s 1995 political action movie, Nick of Time. In that film, the actor was assigned an hour and a half to escape political hot water in the 90s; in this, he and his partner/co-star, Amber Heard, are granted a more generous 50 hours by the Australian agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. Joyce makes a fairly deranged villain; the couple’s dogs, he snarls, will be executed by the government if Heard and Depp fail to remove them from the country in time. Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo radiate a natural if understated gravitas in their breakthrough performances. Thus a moral dilemma to springboard the second act: who do we root for? The bad arse, blasé, aviator-clad, double-earring wearing hunk and his beautiful partner (Heard is terrific here; her doe-eyed presence recalls the early work of French New Wave pioneer Anna Karina)? Or the burly, weatherbeaten borderline psychopath, who just threatened to use federal powers to execute the couple’s adorable tiny dogs? It is a difficult choice. Tension slackens in the second act, as the key players spend more time independent of each other, and the plot takes on some implausible developments. In an improbable turn of events, Joyce becomes the deputy prime minister of Australia: surely an act of over-reaching on behalf of the screenwriters. A second unexpected twist sees Heard take centre stage and emerge as the key player. Media outlets the world over had reported Pistol and Boo as Depp’s dogs; he was therefore at the core of the narrative. Few people could have anticipated Heard would emerge as the protagonist, a sort of reverse The Lady Vanishes. She was here all the time. And nobody, bar nobody, could possibly have imagined how this sensational affair would end. First, there’s a courtroom scene – more sombre than suspenseful – in which a repentant Heard pleads guilty to falsifying an immigration document. But it’s the final scene that’s surprise clincher: rough and tense, like a home-shot version of Black Mirror crossed with London Has Fallen. Or, more simply, something that looks quite a lot like a hostage video. Talking direct-to-cam in a low-angle shot, Depp on the left and Heard on the right, the pair sit in front of nondescript off-white curtains appearing stiff and solemn, looking like botched statuettes from the world’s saddest Madame Tussauds museum. Heard speaks of Australia’s “treasure trove of unique plants” and Depp morosely advises viewers to “declare everything when you enter Australia”. He performs a small nod of his head but to who? To the audience, in a fourth-wall-breaking moment? Or to somebody just off-screen? Could Joyce also be there, holding up a script for the pair to read while their entourage sit in the adjacent room with potato sacks on their heads? Like the final, cryptic shot in the great Austrian director Michael Haneke’s psychological thriller Hidden, we can’t ever be sure.\n",
      "Premier League 2016-17 preview: 11 things to look out for this season 1. Manchester manager wars So here it is – the long-awaited new series of Pep versus José. Neutrals are hoping for a classic rerun of the meltdowns that made the Barcelona/Real Madrid years so special – but early signs are that both managers are making an effort to coexist. Last month Guardiola denied he’d spend the season refusing to shake Mourinho’s hand (“We are polite guys, why not shake, why not shake? No reason”), and José says he’s completely over it. “Individual fights make no sense in England. If I focus on him and he on me, someone else is going to win the league.” They meet for the first time at Old Trafford on 10 September. Time will tell. 2. Arsène Wenger’s farewell tour? Away from that excitement, everything feels pretty familiar at the Emirates. On 1 October it will be 20 years since Arsène Wenger took over: 20 years since he told the sceptics: “I am like every human - I have my weaknesses. I would say to you I try every day to be better than the day before, but I am conscious that I have to win over the supporters. They don’t know me.” Two decades later, they do know him, but the “winning over” process is still ongoing. Signs are this will be Wenger’s last at the club. Could it end in glory? 3. Zlatan’s impact Having trailed his Old Trafford move with a Hollywood hashtag – “#iamcoming” – self-billed “king” and “legend” Zlatan Ibrahimovic needs to deliver early on. But, generously, he says he’s prepared to share the headlines with colleagues, including Wayne Rooney. “Every big player can work with other big players. That’s not a problem. I see no problems here. Just success.” 4. Leicester’s tricky encore How do you follow a fairytale? Do it all over again, or slip into graceful decline? N’Golo Kanté is gone, and pre-season has been testing – a 4-0 defeat to PSG and 4-2 to Barcelona – but key title-winners remain, including Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Danny Drinkwater and captain Wes Morgan. Last season Claudio Ranieri said Morgan was “Baloo off the Jungle Book. He is a big gentle bear. He does not speak so much but when he does speak, everybody listens. He is the perfect captain.” 5. The reinvention of David Moyes It’s been a tough few years. Humiliated at United, Moyes achieved meme status when this photo of him meeting fans at Old Trafford went viral – captioned online: “I have no idea what is happening”. Then came 12 grim months at Real Sociedad. But now he’s back, at a club much more like Everton. “In my first season at Everton, after the club had continually avoided relegation, I think we finished seventh,” he said. “Will that happen with Sunderland? It will be very difficult, but I have to believe there’s a possibility.” Expect heavy last-minute spending: Christian Benteke has been linked. 6. New-look homes We’re all invested in West Ham’s new ground, literally. The £701m stadium, with the club chipping in £15m, opened last week, and is a world away from Green Street. The rebrand is neat – but no amount of green sheeting is going to disguise that 30m gap between the stand and the pitch. Elsewhere, Liverpool will unveil their new £114m Main Stand. They paid for it themselves. 7. Hull’s new manager… … is already, before being appointed, being tipped as this season’s sack race winner. Hull’s pre-season bid for crisis-club status has been slick: Steve Bruce walking away, Mohamed Diamé sold down a division to Newcastle, no signings and Assem Allam still in charge. So expect to see a rare sight on the opening day: fans of a newly-promoted club protesting against their board. Hull face champions Leicester in Saturday’s television curtain-raiser (12.30pm on Sky). 8. A new corporate visual identity Always a thrilling moment: a corporate brand identity refresh – the Premier League’s old Barclays logo gone, and, in its place, a new range of expensive fluorescent sponsor-free logos, which attracted online mockery when they were unveiled in February. League officials called the new branding “a bold and vibrant identity that includes a modern take on the lion icon”; everyone else saw it as primary school-style tribute to Aslan. Elsewhere, other badge tweaks this season include Manchester City’s new heritage-led logo, and West Ham removing the Boleyn Castle from their badge and adding the word “London”, to help sell the global brand. 9. Which way are Stoke headed? Will Stoke finish ninth for a fourth consecutive season? Or is something less comfortable in store? Mark Hughes – who starts the campaign with a neat new Jeremy Corbyn beard – has some serious momentum-correcting work to do after last season’s run-in – as does Alan Pardew at Palace, who oversaw two wins in 21 league games before dancing his way to FA Cup final defeat. And, also looking unpredictable among the usual mid-table candidates: the newly wealthy Everton. Ronald Koeman has found his kitty hard to spend so far, but he’s trying. “We are working hard to bring in players. I expect better quality on the ball.” 10. Geometric fuse-welding Back with the marketing department, here’s Nike describing this season’s new official ball, the Ordem 4 – featuring a “new wrapped bladder system delivering optimal touch; geometric 12 panel fuse-welded construction employing a new 3D printed ink technique; plus the design principle of ‘Flow Motion’ applying luminance.” In other words, it’s round and colourful. The Premier League ball is blue, green and purple, La Liga’s is navy, orange and yellow, Serie A’s is orange, pink and purple. Collect all three for £285. 11. New rules 95 law changes were announced in May, so expect a long season of indignant mixed-up punditry. Apart from backwards kick-offs, other changes include no more automatic reds for players who accidentally deny a scoring opportunity and an end to forcing injured players to leave the field after quick treatment. But likely to have the biggest impact are changes around dissent. This season it’s an automatic yellow for “showing visible disrespect to officials”; for “running towards an official to contest a decision”; for making any physical contact with officials; and it’s a yellow “for at least one player when two or more surround a match official”. Players who add aggression or abuse to any of the above will upgrade to an automatic red. Stand by for mass suspensions.\n",
      "Zayn Malik: Mind of Mine review – downbeat sex jams drive assured rebrand Despite his protests of ignorance, the timing of Zayn Malik’s debut solo album, Mind of Mine, feels pretty significant. It comes out a year ago to the day after he released a statement confirming he’d left One Direction, the juggernaut, X Factor-created boyband that had propelled him from a slightly bored-looking teenager to a slightly bored-looking, incredibly wealthy adult. After leaving the group, he explained that he wanted to be “a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight”. Months after a very public spat with producer Naughty Boy, signing a solo deal with RCA Records and starting a relationship with model and reality TV star Gigi Hadid after an acrimonious split with his pop star fiancé Perrie Edwards, however, it appears he simply got bored of being normal. Set among the perma-smiling, chino-sporting lineup of One Direction, there was always something oddly compelling about Malik’s indifference. Rarely the most vocal in interviews or the most animated onstage (his moves largely boiled down to fiddling with his ear piece and pouting), his allure came from seemingly doing nothing at all. It was like he was chiselled from marble; blank but intriguing. While the smart money went on Harry Styles to forge a solo career, Malik took on the Robbie Williams role, a twinkly-eyed loose cannon who loves his mum but who couldn’t keep himself out of the tabloids (weed smoking, allegations of affairs, terrible tattoos). If various interviews are to be believed, he has barely spoken to his former bandmates since. It’s this outsider status – along with his hasty derision for his old band’s music – that makes his transition from Mumfordesque ballads and pepped-up pop anthems to weed-fuelled downbeat sex jams on Mind of Mine feel like less of a stretch than if Niall Horan had done it. The importance of getting the first single right means recent UK and US No 1 Pillowtalk is basically a checklist of heavy-handed, I’m-a-man-not-a-boy rebellion. So there’s swearing (“fucking and fighting” to “piss off the neighbours”), alongside that Weeknd-esque trope of conflating pain and pleasure into one woozy, weed-filled 4am tryst. There’s also lashings of overwrought guitar, as though rock’n’roll still signals danger. Thankfully, Malik settles into a less ham-fisted groove as the album unfolds (although its title and artwork both suggest he hasn’t completely mastered subtlety yet). The excellent first half showcases his Frank Oceanesque falsetto on the sad-eyed, organ-drenched It’s You (produced by Channel Orange’s main producer, Malay), and on Befour’s pulsating electro-throb there’s a head-spinning vocal performance you don’t tend to get from a former boyband members, Justin Timberlake aside. Perhaps the album’s highlight is the double whammy of mid-tempo standouts She and Drunk, with the former featuring a fairly cold and distant lyric about Malik offering no solace to someone in need (“She wants somebody to love, to hold her”), while the latter’s percolating emotion finally offers a glimpse behind the cool-guy exterior (“Red eyes, amnesia, I need ya,” he coos). From the lovely, pastoral intermission Flower (sung in Urdu in recognition of Malik’s Pakistani heritage), the album’s quality dips slightly, the downcast tempo and reverb-heavy finger-click beats becoming vaporous by the time he and Kehlani swap hazily lustful lines on Wrong (weirdly, the excellent, upbeat Like I Would is relegated to the deluxe edition). There’s still time for surprising moments – Fool For You’s Lennon-inspired piano-lead ballad, the lovely Rear View (“It sounds like you need a friend”) and the glitchy Timberlake-isms of the closing TIO – but the meandering Lucozade is a chorus-less mumble, while the slowburn Truth is lost in the second-half fog. The lasting impression of Mind of Mine, however, is of someone finally making the music they’ve wanted to make for a long time. That the sound he’s chosen – clipped beats, hazy production flourishes, oodles of falsetto as a shortcut for emotional honesty – is basically 2016 writ large may seem bandwagon-jumping, but there’s more than enough good stuff here to suggest it’s been created with love rather than with an eye on ticking boxes. You sense he’s had enough of the latter to last him a lifetime.\n",
      "Fat White Family: Songs for Our Mothers review – the modern Throbbing Gristle As the song titles (Goodbye Goebbels, When Shipman Decides) on Fat White Family’s second album show, the south London squat-rockers love to provoke. Songs for Our Mothers, then, is nothing of the sort, its grimy fusion of Germanic disco (Whitest Boy on the Beach), demonic swamp rock (Duce) and drug-addled noise (We Must Learn to Rise) positing the band as a modern Throbbing Gristle. What they’re trying to say isn’t always clear – are they sixth-form shock merchants or more profound? – but the five-piece most impress at their least confrontational. Hits Hits Hits, inspired by abusive relationships, is loose-limbed psych-funk with a shot of creepiness.\n",
      "Cult heroes: Deniz Tek – Stooges fan and fighter pilot who took punk to Australia Over a career spanning more than 40 years as a guitarist and songwriter, Deniz Tek has been remarkably consistent, though not necessarily prolific. Tek, who is best known for his work with the Australian proto-punk band Radio Birdman, averages a studio album or EP release every two to three years, and has often gone several years between releases. However, he has a few other strings to his bow. By the time Radio Birdman released their scorching debut EP Burn My Eye in 1976, Tek was already studying medicine. He became a flight surgeon with the US navy, where he also trained as a fighter pilot, and now divides his time between rock’n’roll and working as a trauma surgeon in in Australia and Hawaii. Clearly, he’s not one of those musicians who’s at a loss when they haven’t got a gig lined up. Tek was born and grew up in the US, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he would sneak into gigs by the MC5 and the Stooges, who proved to be among his primary influences. When his father, an engineering professor, was offered a year’s secondment at the University of New South Wales in Sydney in 1967, the family temporarily relocated to Australia. After graduating from high school in the US, Tek wanted to pursue his own degree in medicine and he decided to study in Sydney. By the time he had seen the Rolling Stones on their 1972 Australian tour – and sold a vintage National guitar to Keith Richards, no less – it was clear that music was going to be as much a part of his life as his curative vocation. While Tek had a direct connection to the Detroit sound that had developed in his home state, Radio Birdman evolved more or less in isolation in Sydney; something that Tek believes benefited the band. Although that had its downsides – Birdman were ignored and even disdained by the music industry in Australia, and had to book their own venues to play concerts – it made them even more committed to their unique brand of high-energy rock’n’roll. When I was growing up in Australia, too young to have seen Birdman in their 1976-78 prime, the band were almost mythical. It was a code among music freaks: you may have known the Ramones and the Clash and even the Saints, but unless you knew of Birdman you were a no-mark. Their instantly recognisable logo was seen on cars, guitars, school lockers and surfboards in every town on the east coast – surf music was the thing that gave Birdman their identity above and beyond the Detroit sound. Birdman dissolved acrimoniously in 1978, and despite a few appearances by key members in several post-Birdman bands, it wasn’t until Tek toured Australia in 1992 that the first post-Birdman generation got to see some of their songs live (hundreds of other bands playing earnest cover versions notwithstanding). The fact that Birdman’s other guitarist, Chris Masuak, and their keyboardist, Pip Hoyle, were on board for Tek’s solo tour only added to the expectation. Tek had recently retired from the US military, but he was understandably proud of his accomplishments. The solo album that formed the basis of the 1992 tour was called Take It to the Vertical, and featured a cover image of Tek in the cockpit of an F4 Phantom. That was a revelation in itself, as few Birdman fans at the time had any idea he had another career outside music. Then it turned out he was also an emergency surgeon based in Billings, Montana. For anyone who read the music press, it was obvious he was a fairly remarkable individual. But more than anything else, the concerts proved that Tek’s music and his guitar playing had lost none of their power. Since then, Radio Birdman have reformed several times, and their reputation has not diminished. Tek still plays with complete commitment – as he once put it, when he’s on the road he’s “hard-wired to the go switch”. In 2014, at the age of 62, playing solo and Radio Birdman material in a power trio in Europe, he did 29 concerts in 28 days across eight countries. It looks as if 2016 is turning into another busy year for him: Radio Birdman are touring Australia in June, followed by a three-week European tour, and in September, Tek is releasing his sixth solo album. He’s not one for standing still – and long may that continue.\n",
      "The end of the night – in the 80s, the Wag Club was glorious but it could never happen now As the march of gentrification and greed transforms London – as well as many of the UK’s other inner cities – one great British institution that has fallen foul has been the nightlife business. In London, the area that has suffered the most is Soho. Once a naughty, massively inspiring little Petri dish from which the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud emerged, it is being rapidly reshaped into something resembling a homogenised shopping mall. One of the first institutions to fall foul of the evisceration of Soho was the Wag, the club Ollie O’Donnell and I founded in 1982 and which ran until 2001. When we began, Soho was really rather seedy and rundown, which was exactly what attracted the young, the groovy and the inventive. The Wag – a nightclub that catered, in the main, to a gang of non-conformist mavericks – was thoroughly appropriate to that crowd. Ollie and I started by packing out the Whisky a Go Go in Wardour Street every Saturday night with our own crowd, then the club’s new leaseholders asked us to run it with them full time. So we lowered the drinks and the door price (which was possible because rents were fair back then), pulled in DJs who played underground music, and the place took off. We were young and aware, so we knew what was happening and approached the running of the club with a zeal that at times dropped us in the proverbial. In November 1982, we hosted the first ever hip-hop club event in the UK, The Roxy Road Show – featuring 25 artists who flew in from New York, including Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore (who invented scratching), Jazzy Jay and Fab 5 Freddy, rope skipping stars the Double Dutch Girls and legendary breakdancers the Rock Steady Crew. It was complete and utter mayhem, but in a good way. The club was absolutely packed when, at my behest, then unknown graffiti artist Futura 2000 did his live spray-can art on stage and more or less asphyxiated everyone. We later made a name for ourselves by booking all the major rap acts – De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Eric B and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E Fresh. It’s been said that we were responsible for breaking hip-hop in the UK but, for me, it made sense in every way: the acts had never played London before, and it was relatively cheap to bring them over. All it took was two or three discounted flights and a couple of nights in a friend’s dad’s hotel in Bloomsbury. Simple economics. Because I’d been in a band it was my job to source, book and promote the live acts. Sometimes they worked and other times they did not. Even though we all knew of Shane MacGowan’s proclivities I booked Pogue Mahone just as they were starting off. The third time they played, MacGowan was so drunk I was surprised he could stand, never mind sing, but it made no difference because the show stopped after 20 minutes when he tried to hit bassist Cait O’Riordan over the head with his guitar. Then there was the legendary jazz maestro Slim Gaillard, who sold out the club but, rather in his cups, retired to the bar after two songs, fell asleep on it and woke up two hours later, his backing band and the crowd having long departed. I turned down a Prince afterparty/jam session because I’d already booked Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry on the same night. He cost us a packet, but the club was crammed so all was OK until Perry, somewhat chemically enhanced, sang the same song (his new single) 15 times and emptied the club before midnight. We lost our shirts. But there were bigger losses – Bobby Womack’s show was cancelled an hour before it was due to start because of a bomb scare round the corner in Leicester Square; Gil Scott Heron’s gig was called off when he was arrested at Heathrow for possession of cocaine. Both had sold out and we had to refund all ticket holders, leaving us with the cost of the flights and hotel rooms. Of course, other acts were simply magnificent. I recall the surprise on Georgie Fame’s face as he looked out at the crowd of immaculate mods, dressed just as they would have when he played the Flamingo (in the basement of the Whisky a Go Go) in 1962. James Brown’s backing band the JBs were gobsmacked that the crowd (many in 70s kit) knew all their numbers by heart. New acts thrived, too: Sade, Fine Young Cannibals, Curiosity Killed the Cat, the Pasadenas and Swing Out Sister were all signed after shows at the Wag. The Wag was synonymous with what was happening on the street. We played a huge role in kick-starting the acid house movement by hosting sets from Marshall Jefferson, Tony Humphries, Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry and Masters at Work, among many others, while Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong and Andy Weatherall established their reps at the Wag. But it wasn’t just about music. It was also about meeting people and showing off. Diehard regular Jonathan Ross met his wife Jane Goldman at the Wag. Designers such as John Galliano paraded their designs here; Leigh Bowery strutted his magnificent stuff; future Turner prize winners Tracey Emin and Grayson Perry were regulars; Boy George, Joe Strummer and Neneh Cherry came every week for a little dance. All the attention meant global superstars came to our little ramshackle venue (with no VIP area) for a look: David Bowie (who came a lot and filmed his Blue Jean video there), Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Prince, George Clinton, Stevie Wonder, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier. George Michael had a fight with our DJ Fat Tony and Grace Jones had to be physically restrained after laying out an irritating bloke with a single punch. Some have said that at one point the Wag was the grooviest club on the planet, but I couldn’t tell. I was too busy trying to fill a Tuesday night. None had this would have happened had we not been in our mid-20s, not that different from most of our patrons, and brave (or stupid) enough to take chances and, most importantly, had the rent not been cheap enough for us to experiment. Today, not only would I not be able to run a West End club, I wouldn’t even be able to hang out in Soho, because landlords and developers have priced the young and not-so-well-off out of inner London. It has been suggested that London should follow Amsterdam, Paris, Zurich and Toulouse and appoint a night mayor to protect our after-dark businesses and the people who use them. Certainly, unless something is done we will lose the talent that has traditionally risen through our night-time economy – graphic designers, artists, DJs, entertainers writers, photographers and musicians of every kind who hone their skills and develop by working with clubs and promoters. I don’t think its possible to overestimate just how important this is for any city or country, and that is why Amsterdam, Paris and Zurich are protecting their nightlife. We have to follow suit before it’s too late. Chris Sullivan presents The Wag Club is available now on Harmless Records.\n",
      "Lush review – pithy indie chroniclers stage a confident comeback This is Lush’s first show in almost 20 years, so the nerves are understandable. “I was shitting myself yesterday,” admits singer and guitarist Miki Berenyi, still swearing like a trooper. Really though, you wouldn’t know she’s spent most of the intervening period as a magazine subeditor rather than a hard-gigging frontwoman. It’s a crisp, confident comeback from the early-90s indie stalwarts. Berenyi’s trademark fluorescent barnet is now a sober jet black – “no red hair, deal with it!” – and Justin Welch (once of Elastica) has replaced drummer Chris Acland, whose tragic suicide precipitated Lush’s split back in 1996. Otherwise, little has changed. Maybe because they haven’t spent the last two decades acquiring annoying muso habits, Lush sound almost exactly like they did when they were last in circulation. De Luxe remains brilliantly confounding, Hypocrite charmingly venomous, Lit Up a hit of pure sugary goodness. New song Out of Control slips into the set so snugly you’d be hard-pressed to tell it apart. The compliment is faintly double-edged – Lush have always written to a formula, albeit a pretty good one: off-kilter pop songs, distinguished by wobbly high harmonies and a glittery guitar haze. Despite being signed to 4AD, they were never too precious about their sonic cathedrals. It’s the quality and consistency of their songwriting that shines through here, and that’s without even playing Britpop-era hits Single Girl or 500 (Shake Baby Shake). Songs such as For Love and the dreamy, tormented Desire Lines may no longer represent the lives of Berenyi or her fellow frontwoman Emma Anderson, but they are reminders that Lush were pithy and vital chroniclers of the young female experience in the overwhelmingly blokey domain of alternative rock. It’s hard to tell at this stage whether Lush’s career will gain a prolonged second act, but this underrated band still have the power to inspire. Lush play Coachella festival, California on 16 and 23 April, then touring the US\n",
      "Blaine Harrison's playlist: Declan McKenna, Daughter, David Gilmour and more Declan McKenna – Paracetamol I was introduced to Declan’s music by a friend of the band last year and was immediately taken by his song Brazil. Here was a 15-year-old kid with the ability to write poignant lyrics about the misappropriation of wealth in that country around the time of the World Cup. I connected with the spirit of the song. Paracetamol is a song made of the same substance, but has a vulnerability to it reminiscent of the great songs Daniel Johnston used to sing into a tape recorder in his parents’ basement. We took Declan out to eat pizza in London and when he turned up dressed like the Karate Kid we immediately decided he had to open for us on our tour. Screaming Peaches – Sad Kid Someone first played me this song on a broken iPhone in the back of an Uber and I immediately liked the way they spelled out their lyrics (who doesn’t like spelled out lyrics?), but then all of a sudden someone else started listening to something completely different on their phone in the front of the car and I couldn’t tell what was being spelled out anymore and got very confused. When I arrived home I looked them up and realised I’d inadvertently been a fan for longer than I thought under their previous moniker, MOVIE. If I wasn’t so lazy I would re-organise my record collection and find a nice slot for them between something like The Chap and Darts of Pleasure-era Franz Ferdinand. I’m not sure anyone really knows what pop music is or isn’t anymore, but this song has a cheeky riff and is catchy as hell. Gaz Coombes – Needle’s Eye I can remember Supergrass’s first album coming out like it was yesterday, their otherworldly faces staring down at me from the covers of magazines in French supermarkets on summer holidays. And what a live force they were, too, like the best bits of every 60s band – the instruments seemingly racing each other to the finishing line of each song. We had the privilege of getting to know Gaz on the festival circuit while touring our last album Radlands and we became huge fans of his second solo release, Matador, when it came out. Detroit was one of, if not the, best song of last year but I’m going to pick another from the same record. With a backbone provided by a morse-code bassline and these huge emotive lyrics, Needle’s Eye feels equally honest and urgent – like the kind of song he needed to live before he could write it. Daughter – Doing the Right Thing Long car journeys have always been synonymous with music for me, and I can vividly remember my dad playing me Lou Reed’s Satelite of Love en route to the airport when I was a kid. I was welling up, sad to be leaving him and had never flown alone before when he put this song on, as if showing me that music was able to articulate something beyond words. Leaving something behind, watching the past disappear in the rear view mirror. I soon became addicted to that feeling. I spend a lot of time driving around London and once in a while a song will come on the radio that catches you off guard and somehow perfectly crystallises a place and moment in time. I had one of those with this song, driving to visit an elderly relative one frosty winter morning last year. The lyrics painted a picture of something very familiar to me at that time, loosing someone close to you to something you don’t understand. Mesmerising. David Gilmour - There’s No Way Out Of Here Growing up, my parents’ friends had a son who was about 10 years older than me and epitomised everything I wanted to be when I grew up into a teenager. His room smelled like a heady mix of CK one and fags, he had one of those giant Swatch watches on his wall – and the Turin Shroud to any nine-year-old in the 90s: a black Fender Stratocaster. As it also turned out, after some digging around in his cupboards when he was away one weekend, he also had a great CD collection (all the Oasis singles, all the Shine compilations etc). I’ve only ever stolen once in my life, and I will admit here and now that his copy of A Collection of Great Dance Songs by Pink Floyd was that one time (sorry, mate, but actually it changed my life forever, so thank you). Pink Floyd’s shores have been colonised to the point of exhaustion, but Dave Gilmour’s first solo album was one stone I’d never thought to turn over. It became something of an anthem for us during the recording of our new album Curve of the Earth, and most importantly, it was written at his absolute peak, when he looked like a hot girl. So much so, in fact, that the world neglected to notice that he wore the same Guinness Stout T-shirt for the entirety of the Dark Side of the Moon tour. Baller.\n",
      "Why did the UK change its mind about Brexit? The wedding could hardly have been more tranquil. As midnight struck on the morning of 1 January 1973 – and Jesus Christ Superstar began its run on the London stage, and the first British hypermarket was sucking in shoppers, while Pink Floyd were about to launch the best-selling album in British pop history, and the motor industry was preparing to give the world the Austin Allegro – the United Kingdom was officially joined to the European Economic Community. Here and there people held celebrations – some even lit bonfires – yet most of the land was asleep. Writing the front-page story, a duty that fell to me as the ’s political reporter at the time, was deeply unsatisfying. Something that everyone knew was about to happen, had happened! Hardly a story that anyone yearns to write. There had been enough excitement and turmoil throughout the previous year. Edward Heath, unexpected victor of the 1970 election and as fervent a champion of Britain in Europe as anyone on the planet, had safely steered us in. It is often asserted now that the British public backed that judgment; in fact it wasn’t given the chance. Heath would hear no talk of a referendum, since he might have lost it. The polls showed public opinion running against British entry, and though in those days, leaders liked to believe that an endorsement from them might be enough to sway uncertain voters, Heath knew he might risk destroying a project at the heart of his political life. His battles came over the European Communities bill, the essential preliminary to accession, approved at second reading on 17 February 1972 by a majority of just eight. Though Labour in office had tried and failed to join Europe, they were now against it. Harold Wilson, the leader Heath had supplanted, said the terms for entry were not acceptable. But the party divergence was not what it seemed. A group of Labour MPs wholly committed to membership formed a surreptitious ancillary force for the Tories. The Conservative chief whip, Francis Pym – sternly instructed by Heath that he must not lose a single vote – would tell the Labour dissidents how many abstentions were needed on each division, and they would provide them. As a newly arrived Westminster reporter, I pestered Pym, who was under cruel pressure to deliver, about this arrangement. He and the chief Labour dissidents would explain how it worked. Perhaps the toughest night was when it came to a vote on a referendum, proposed by a Tory backbencher, which the Labour shadow cabinet agreed to back – a decision that triggered the resignation of the deputy leader Roy Jenkins. But again, as reporters in the press gallery waited hopefully for a sensational story, the Labour rebels saved the day for the Tories: 63 Labour MPs abstained. A Tory leader under pressure had calculated correctly, and got what he wanted. The referendum denied to the country then came two years later, in 1975, when Wilson was back in power. The call came now from continuing opponents of British membership, and especially Tony Benn – the mentor from whom Jeremy Corbyn would learn his long distrust of Brussels. Wilson began by opposing it, before scenting some merit in the idea. Handled well – a renegotiation to begin the process, to be followed by claims that the EC’s deterrent factors had now been extinguished – and the referendum might help cement Britain’s allegiance to the EEC. A persuasive case could be made for perpetuation. We had only been in the EEC two years, too short a time to justify permanent rejection. In any case, the people could be relied on to plump for more of the same rather than risky adventure. Voting not to join an organisation was one thing: voting to leave it and shuffle out into the cold was quite another. That year’s Brexit was duly rejected by a margin of three to two. A Labour leader under pressure had calculated correctly, and got what he wanted. It’s said that David Cameron hoped to emulate Wilson’s success, using a renegotiation to argue that the organisation in which he believed we should stay was a very different beast from the one that had become so widely distrusted. But the circumstances of the 2016 referendum were different from those surrounding Wilson’s triumph. The European union of 2016 is vastly different from the EEC, vastly more likely to engineer change or frustrate the kind of changes that many UK voters yearn for; dominant in ways that people find menacing. The mere Economic Community had no great ambitions for wholesale political and economic integration. You had to be there, I suppose, to get a sense of the transformations of these past 40 years. Only those approaching their 60s can know, except by deduction, how things felt. Looking back, the world of 1975 seems not just unsophisticated, but strangely naive. In those days, when I travelled the land trying to get the sense of a coming election, it was customarily assumed that the component regions of the UK were likely to behave in much the same way. It was further assumed that when a political leader spoke, people listened; and further that when the day of decision came, they would always choose what they knew over what was largely unknown, and certainly wholly untasted. The voice of the expert was loud in the land and largely respected. Two years (1973-75) isn’t long to start building up resentments: 41 years (1975-2016) is more than enough. There was, too, no equivalent then of social media, where dissidents can so easily come together and disrupt their masters’ ambitions. Instinctive deference and a stoic acceptance of one’s dissatisfactions had yet to be abandoned. People blame Corbyn for not giving Labour voters a stronger lead. But that’s not how things work any more. Whatever Corbyn had said, the legions of dispossessed Britain, making their protests on Thursday across much of the North, the Midlands and Wales, would not have taken much notice – any more than that former heartland of unswerving loyalty, the Conservative party, dutifully heeded to the voice of its leader. It has been coming for quite a while – see the fate of Labour in last year’s election, not just in Scotland – but we see at this moment more clearly than ever that the old and comforting certainties that used to be the bedrock of British politics are shattering day by day. There were always political shocks, but never before has the golden rule more clearly been: expect the unexpected. The quiet wedding that began in the earliest hours of 1 January 1973 ended at breakfast time yesterday morning, not just in divorce – but even, in this sense, in the cemetery.\n",
      "Peaches review – a masterclass in gleeful subversion There can be few better places to spend the night after a Donald J Trump presidential victory than at a gig by Peaches, the outré Canadian electropop artist. If you need succour, it is everywhere – in the regal headdress that Peaches wears for her opening song, Rub, whose centrepiece is a vulva; in the giant inflatable condom in which Peaches prances about during Dick in the Air, shooting silly string out from its tip; in the fans, turned out in get-ups almost as elaborate and smutty as those on stage. If conservatives have gained the upper hand in the Oval Office, tonight east London’s Oval Space remains a playground for people wearing Lycra with holes in interesting places, for men adjusting their makeup in both-sex toilets. It’s hard to stay gloomy for long when confronted by two shaggy, dancing vulvas on a song called Vaginoplasty from Peaches’s 2015 tour de force album, also called Rub. When Peaches reappears after a short costume change, with six breasts dangling from her (one in her crotch), she looks like a grotesque extra from the Star Wars cantina scene, probably cinema’s most obvious bastion of diversity and tolerance. Although there is plenty of eroticism at Peaches gigs, titillation is often not the whole point: gleeful subversion is. Through a 16-year body of work that spans catchy synthpop, skeletal electro, hard rock and Peaches Christ Superstar, a one-woman performance of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, the woman born 48 years ago as Merrill Nisker has created a parallel universe light years away from the norm. The norm is a harsh, squalid place where women’s bodies are still too often men’s playthings, extreme porn is widely distributed among schoolchildren and “slut-shaming” goes hand in hand with heteronormativity. In Peaches’s world, sex is a free-for-all, fun and frequently absurd. Shame does not exist. All genitalia and proclivities are equal. Pussy-grabbing is frequent, but always consensual. The tide of images of women’s bodies distorted by the male gaze – shaven pudenda, siliconed mammaries – is countered with a surge of ridiculously exaggerated privates and lots of jiggling. Just at the corner of the punk-rock sneer, there is a sly grin. The risk here, though, is that the nonstop erotic cabaret of Peaches’s live show might overshadow her professionalism, that Peaches remains infamous for being a six-breasted freak, rather than the writer of frequently excellent songs. Tonight, her style and her substance are defiantly equal too. Her least X-rated song remains one of her strongest – Talk to Me, from 2009’s I Feel Cream album, which comes early in the set. “This ain’t a Peaches show,” she sings to a passive-aggressive romantic partner, “it’s just me and you.” Her wide and confidently used vocal range is another thing often overshadowed by all the engorged set dressing. Her wordplay mixes the stark aggression of hip-hop and the kind of freewheeling assonance that recalls Dr Seuss. Rub’s Free Drink Ticket is intense, a spoken-word successor of sorts to Talk to Me, in which Peaches once again lambasts a lover who doesn’t communicate, or worse, lies. “Your personality turned to white powder/ Your brain’s clammed-up chowder,” Peaches spits, fearsomely. “I gave and you pretended.” For Peaches, lying is a cardinal sin. Contrast this with current political discourse, as witnessed in the Trump presidential campaign and the Leave campaign before it. It’s a mark of how strange things have become when the mainstream needs to take a lesson in moral rectitude from a topless, pan-sexual provocateur whose T-shirts ask: “Whose jizz is this?” (after a Dick in the Air lyric). But that’s where we are now. For a woman whose 2006 album was entitled Impeach My Bush, making reference to the misdemeanours of the then-US president, George W, Peaches doesn’t mention current events for a very long time. She finally gets around to it near the end. “I’d rather not say the name,” she mutters, before launching into a song called Dumb Fuck, “but he’s a dumb fuck.” It’s hard to know where Peaches can go after this bravura performance. But, naturally, there are still places. The night’s second encore is Light in Places, a gauzy disco song in which Peaches’s double entendres redouble again. The stage is dark but for the dancers’ butt-plug torches, beaming from places the sun doesn’t normally light up.\n",
      "Jeff Lynne's ELO announced for Glastonbury 2016 Jeff Lynne’s ELO will be taking to Glastonbury’s Pyramid Stage on Sunday 26 June, taking the afternoon slot traditionally filled by beloved entertainers of a certain age. Lynne follows the likes of Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie, who have attracted huge crowds to the festivals main stage for crowdpleasing sets of old favourites. Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis claimed Parton attracted the biggest crowd the event had ever seen when she appeared in 2014. The return and rise of Jeff Lynne and ELO has been one of music’s surprise stories of the past few years. When Lynne released an album under the ELO name in 2001, Zoom, it reached only No 34 in the UK charts. However, after Lynne appeared at a Children in Need benefit concert in November 2013, he was persuaded by Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans to perform under the ELO name at a Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park. The 50,000 tickets for the show sold out in 15 minutes, since when Jeff Lynne’s ELO have announced sellout arena shows and released an album, Alone in the Universe, that reached No 4 in the UK. The Sunday afternoon appearance by an older musician has become known as the “legend slot” owing to the calibre of the artists appearing in it. Last October, Leo Sayer claimed he was in the running to fill the bill in 2016, saying on ITV’s Loose Women: “It’s on the cards man. I want do to it. Why not?”\n",
      "Macaulay Culkin: ‘No, I was not pounding six grand of heroin a month’ Of all modern myths, it is the fall of the child star that most compels us. Whether they’re embarking on 55-hour marriages, throwing bongs out of windows or abandoning monkeys at customs, we can’t seem to get enough. There’s something pathological in our need to tear down our icons of innocence, which might explain the overprotective nature of Macaulay Culkin’s US publicist, who wants to see all my questions upfront. I refuse. I thought we could just ... have a chat? The interview, Culkin’s biggest in 10 years, is supposed to focus on his comeback. I’m instructed to avoid anything negative. I ask if I can ask if he has any regrets. “Regrets sounds too negative,” is the response. When we meet, in the lobby of a hotel in Spain, I’m still trying to figure out what exactly this comeback consists of. Culkin’s filming an advert for Compare the Market, which is obviously not a passion project. “It was fun, and we hammered that sucker out pretty quickly. The biggest scene was me sitting on a bench eating ice-cream.” Is he doing this to fund an exciting new venture? “No, not necessarily.” He’s dressed grungily, long hair man-bunned back, boots open-laced, blazer badge-studded. He doesn’t project the focused careerism of most actors. “People feel they have to be in perpetual motion, or drown. I’ve never had a problem saying I’ve got nothing lined up. Maybe I’ll take the next year off.” It sounds as if he’s not particularly drawn to acting at all. “I’m not much active,” he concedes. “If I knew what I wanted to do, I’d be writing it myself.” The trajectory of Culkin’s life feels like fallout from an atomic blast. By the age of 12, Uncle Buck, two Home Alone films, My Girl and (to a lesser extent) Richie Rich had made him the most successful child actor of all time. At 14, he became legally emancipated from his parents; both had been trying to gain control of his $17m fortune in their divorce. Culkin married at 17, and separated two years later. Sleepovers with Michael Jackson became public knowledge when he was called as a defence witness at the singer’s molestation trial. I’m ghoulishly fascinated by this alien childhood. I’d like to ask about Michael Jackson. “I think it’s best you don’t,” interjects his manager. She is one of three people sitting with us. “It’s not that it’s a painful topic ...” begins Culkin. His manager insists we move on, the PR next to her agrees. Culkin clearly wants to say something, but six eyes are telling him not to. I suspect we’re both wondering why we’re here; 35-year-old Culkin doesn’t do this sort of thing any more, having turned his back on the spotlight. “I don’t just turn my back, I actively don’t want it. The paps go after me because I don’t whore myself out.” He has spent a decade turning down interviews, and mostly lives in France, where the aloof Parisians leave him alone. (It’s also where Kevin McCallister’s family were headed when they left him Home Alone, but we can’t talk about that.) I get the impression he’s as eager to talk about a price comparison website as I am to ask about one. Instead, I ask why people are still fascinated by him. “I have no idea. I was thinking about this the other day – I’d crossed the wrong street, picked up a tail, suddenly there’s a crush of 20 paparazzi. Then people with cameraphones get involved. I don’t think I’m worthy of that.” Has it got better with time? “It’s been like that my whole adult life. You take on a prey-like attitude, always scanning the horizon. It’s strange on dates, as it looks like you’re not paying attention. But I’ve stopped trying to think of myself in the third person, because that’s just gonna drive me nuts.” You had to think about yourself in the third person? “Exactly. Macaulay Culkin is out there, and I’m Mac. You guys can play with the first one.” He’s not averse to a bit of playing himself, for Culkin is the celebrity’s meta-celebrity. You may remember the meme-meltdown a few years back when Ryan Gosling was pictured wearing a T-shirt of Kevin McCallister. Culkin responded by creating a T-shirt that pictured Gosling wearing the shirt, before Gosling responded in kind, being photographed wearing a T-shirt of Culkin wearing a T-shirt of Gosling wearing a T-shirt of Culkin. They may still be at it for all we know. Culkin’s previous ads, for the likes of Orange (and, in a Partridge move, the rebranding of Norwich Union), trade in close-to-the-bone self-analysis. For Compare the Market, he plays a hitchhiker picked up by the lovable meerkats, who see him as a child, buying him ice-cream and making him ride merry-go-rounds he’s too big for. In 2006, Culkin wrote an experimental novel, Junior, from the perspective of a certifiable child star with father issues. In web comedy :DRYVRS, he’s a blood-spattered sadist, unhinged by the childhood trauma of parental abandonment, and defending himself against home invaders. Is all this self-quoting what he’s drawn to, or just what he gets offered? “A bit of both. It suits my personality and sense of humour. But I would be game for something non-self-referential.” Given this dilemma – constantly returning to a past he wants distance from – where does his sense of self come from? “From me. I try to figure out what makes me happy – and not in a superficial way. I keep my soul fit.” Is he spiritual? “I know enough to know I don’t know. I was raised Catholic, so there’s a lot of guilt. We’re born with original sin.” He veers off into a joke. “Since I was told that, I’ve been trying to come up with even more original sins, that’ll really blow my priest away at confession. Like, here’s one you haven’t heard – it involves a pitching wedge, a donkey and a bucket of ice.” And two meerkats? “Yeah! You might wanna record this one!” He reflects. “Actually, I’m very much at peace lately. I can debate with people, and my heart rate never changes.” And Culkin is witty and affable. Funny, but distant. He offers confrontational figures of speech amiably. “If you want to get into an argument with an artist, ask them what art is,” he says. “If you want to make an actor feel uncomfortable, ask them what they’re doing next.” (I hastily scribble out one of the few questions I’ve written down.) Are his debates political? “I have leanings, but I’m the definition of a disenfranchised voter – I think the system is ugly. This whole Trump thing is amazing.” (Trump cameos in Home Alone 2, showing our hero the way to the Plaza Hotel lobby, although we can’t talk about it.) Culkin doesn’t want to be drawn further. “Discussing politics is the quickest way to alienate people, so I don’t wanna go into it.” And Trump has enough column inches? “Exactly! He’s like the Candyman, we have to stop saying his name.” Culkin was acting at four, an age at which no one knows what they want beyond watching cartoons and eating oversugared cereal. Having described himself as “effectively retired”, he works occasionally (voices for Seth Green’s Robot Chicken, cameoing as himself in Zoolander 2), but: “I’m much more proactive with visual arts and writing, my notebook and little projects.” Of the projects that reach the public, most could charitably be classed as divisive. There are paintings: one of the cast of Seinfeld on the set of Wheel of Fortune, being painted, nude, by He-Man. There’s The Wrong Ferrari, a Dadaist knockabout written on ketamine with Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches, shot entirely on iPhones. Most notorious is the Pizza Underground, his Velvet Underground tribute act that replaces the original lyrics with pizza puns (I’m Waiting for Delivery Man, Take a Bite of the Wild Slice). At Nottingham Rock City, the band were pelted with beer and booed off stage as he played a kazoo solo. They cancelled their European dates, citing a “cheesemergency”. My question about all this is: what the hell? “It’s one of those good ideas you have when you’re drunk, and you wake up and forget about it. But we’re taking it to the end of the joke. We have an album coming out, a vinyl pressing with a children’s choir, a symphony orchestra. We’re giving it away, our gift to the world.” Does he still find it funny? “Of course I find it funny! We rhyme mushrooms with mushrooms, come on. It’s the same joke, relentlessly. Like, they’re really doing this?” Culkin enjoys the absurdity his fame bestows. But scrutiny has its downside. In New York, he takes walks at 4am to avoid harassment. On YouTube, one can find clips of him being harassed by wannabe-paps with smartphones. In 2012, photographs of him looking gaunt, almost transparent, set tabloids aflame with stories he was addicted to heroin and oxycodone, following the breakdown of his relationship with Mila Kunis. Given his friendship with Adam Green and Pete Doherty – as well as a previous arrest for possession of marijuana, Xanax and clonazepam – it seemed plausible. Were people right to be worried? “Not necessarily. Of course, when silly stuff is going on – but no, I was not pounding six grand of heroin every month or whatever. The thing that bugged me was tabloids wrapping it all in this weird guise of concern. No, you’re trying to shift papers.” Is there a story there he might want to tell one day, on his own terms? “Perhaps.” Whatever his recreational habits, I’m surprised by how unscrewed-up Macaulay Culkin is. Plans for the summer mainly involve roadying for Har Mar Superstar and Green (with whom he has another lo-fi film out, Aladdin). “Home is where my boots are. I’m a big fan of jumping on people’s tourbuses, making myself useful, doing load-ins and outs. I do everything except the merch table. I tried that, but ... we didn’t sell anything.” He has directionless days. He sleeps in, stays up late, indulges immature humour, bounces around with bad-influence friends. In short, he’s enjoying the adolescence that celebrity stole from him. Ironically, his personal problems and turbulent relationship with the media have also given him a pretty grown-up perspective. Not a bad epilogue for a child star. “It’s allowed me to become the person I am, and I like me, so I wouldn’t change a thing. Not having to do anything for my dinner, financially, lets me treat every gig like it’s the last.” He laughs, and this time addresses himself in the second person. “If it is, I’d think: Culkin, you had a good run.”\n",
      "A new year that changed me: realising I wanted to live, and giving up heroin It was the looks of contempt that did it. I didn’t normally spend new year with my parents and sisters, but that year I did. I had nowhere else to go really as I’d pretty much run out of friends, and time with my family seemed marginally preferable to time on my own. To be clear; this wasn’t about them, it was about me. I’d been a heroin addict for 10 years and my life was a mess. I’d done next to nothing other than a few dead-end jobs from which I was invariably sacked and I got by on a round of handouts and petty crime. Lying had become second nature; I’d been to rehab five years previously and sworn blind to everyone that I was off the smack, but the truth was I’d never been clean for more than a few days. My life had been reduced to the getting and using of heroin. Not that I turned down booze or other drugs; it was just that none of them hit the same sweet spot of nullification. That feeling of feeling nothing. That new year, though, I was forced to feel my shame. I’d arrived – late, of course, what junkie ever arrives anywhere on time? – and my parents had made a great show of welcoming me. Several years later they told me one of the reasons they had always been so pleased to see me was because my arrival was proof that I wasn’t dead. I kissed my mum hello and my dad offered me a drink. “Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ll get one myself.” I went into the kitchen, downed a tumbler full of scotch, before refilling the glass to a more acceptable level and going off to the living room to rejoin the rest of the family. Awkward doesn’t begin to do justice to the misery that followed. My parents began, as they always did, by asking me what I had been up to. I came up with the usual hard luck lines of why what I had previously told them hadn’t happened and how I was sure next year would be different. They sat there and nodded, desperate to believe me. My sisters remained impassive, barely even bothering to say hello. I can’t remember the rest of the evening in detail, but if it ran anything like every other evening, it will have gone something like this. Every now and again I will have announced that I needed to go to the toilet and disappeared for the best part of 20 minutes to shoot up some smack. I’d have then wandered back into the living room as if I’d only been gone for a couple of minutes and slump, barely conscious, back into the chair. This would have been repeated several times until the clock ticked round to midnight – the chimes of freedom that allowed everyone to slope off to bed after the briefest “happy new year” and to escape the horrors of the preceding hours. What I do remember is the contempt in my sisters’ eyes. Normally, nothing could touch me when I was out of it on heroin; it was as if there was a protective barrier between me and the world. If people didn’t like me I seldom noticed, and if I did I wasn’t that bothered. But that New Year’s Eve my sisters broke through my shield and their eyes had seen my soul. Or what was left of it. They may not have known what exactly was wrong with me or just how bad a state I was in, but they had seen enough to give up on me. Loving me had become just too painful; disgust was all that remained. The details of the following morning are equally fuzzy, but something had changed. I couldn’t get my sisters out of my head. Even more striking was the revelation that no matter how much they hated me, it was nothing compared to how much I hated myself. Like most junkies, I often talked to other junkies about how I was going to give up smack. But also like most junkies, I never got round to doing more than getting the occasional methadone script to tide me over a few days of trying not to take quite as much heroin as usual. It was a depressing cycle of failure that only served to reinforce my self-loathing. Yet that New Year’s Eve had been a game changer, because it was also the moment I realised that I wanted to live more than I wanted to die. It took time. Junkies seldom rush anything and I continued to use, with the overdoses becoming more frequent. But within two months I was in rehab, and this time it worked. That was back in 1987. Fingers crossed in March this year I will have been clean and sober for 30 years.\n",
      "Steve Young obituary The singer and songwriter Steve Young, who has died aged 73 from a head injury sustained after a fall, won the admiration of critics and fellow artists in a recording career spanning almost 50 years, while remaining little known outside a hard core of appreciative fans. Nonetheless, he was influential in the country-rock movement of the 1960s and 70s, and was closely allied with the outlaw country movement, which introduced a defiant rock’n’roll attitude into Nashville’s middle-of-the-road country music. Young’s best-known song is Seven Bridges Road, which has been covered by numerous artists including Joan Baez, Rita Coolidge, Iain Matthews and Dolly Parton. The song gave Young his closest brush with stardom when the Eagles released their live recording of it as a single in 1980. Their version (extracted from the Eagles Live concert album) reached 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also became a hit on the country charts. Other Young songs made famous by big-name artists were Montgomery in the Rain, which was recorded by Hank Williams Jr in 1977, and Lonesome, On’ry and Mean, the title song of the 1973 album by Waylon Jennings which helped to establish Jennings’s “outlaw” credentials. Young was born in Georgia and spent his early years moving around Georgia and Alabama as his half-Cherokee father struggled to find work. He regarded Gadsden, Alabama – where his maternal grandmother lived – as the nearest thing he had to a home town. “My father began sharecropping when he was 13 and his sister Eula, who worked with him, was 10,” Young recalled. “I was from a really dysfunctional family. My father would just disappear sometimes … He left us when I was very young.” Nonetheless, both his mother and father had an interest in country and gospel music, and the young Steve developed an ambition to become a musician. His mother eventually bought him a Gibson electric guitar. She remarried and moved, with her son, to Beaumont, Texas, where Steve graduated from high school (he was in the same class as the aspiring blues guitarist Johnny Winter). He played gigs in Texas before moving back to Alabama, but his fondness for playing politically charged folk songs, including some of Bob Dylan’s, made him unpopular in the reactionary Deep South. Having received threats from the Ku Klux Klan, he fled to California with two local folk musicians, Richard Lockmiller and Jim Connor, who had a deal with Capitol Records as Richard & Jim. He played lead guitar in the Skip Battin Band (Battin would later join the Byrds) and joined Van Dyke Parks and Stephen Stills in the Gas Company. Then he was invited to join Stone Country, who recorded an album for RCA that brought Young to the notice of other record companies. He signed a solo deal with A&M and recorded his debut album, Rock Salt & Nails (1969); it comprised mostly cover versions, and featured two former member of the Byrds, Gene Clark and Gram Parsons, but also contained the first recording of Seven Bridges Road. Young’s evocative mix of country, gospel, folk and bluegrass styles was already forming. The album failed to sell, and Young, already tired of the music business, moved to San Francisco with his new wife, the folk singer Terrye Newkirk. He opened a guitar shop in San Anselmo, where his customers included Jerry Garcia and Van Morrison. However, Reprise records lured him with a new deal, and sent him to Nashville to record the album Seven Bridges Road (1972). This too was a flop, despite some enthusiastic reviews. Now with a young son, Young moved to Nashville, but lack of money and his escalating alcohol consumption prompted him to separate from Terrye in 1974 (they later divorced). In 1975-76, he was filmed for the documentary Heartworn Highways, alongside other upcoming “outlaw” performers including Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle, but the film was not released until 1981. Young scuffled a living as a travelling troubadour, when the opportunity arose making albums, which included Honky Tonk Man (1975) and two critically acclaimed albums for RCA, Renegade Picker (1976) and No Place to Fall (1978). These did not sell, driving Young into a pit of alcoholic gloom that took him into rehab at Meharry hospital, Nashville. After a reissue of Seven Bridges Road and a new album, To Satisfy You (1981), failed to ring the cash registers, Young was invited to tour Norway with the Jonas Fjeld Band, and made the album Look Homeward Angel (1986) for the Swedish label Mill Records. He moved to Austin, Texas and cut the album Solo/Live (1991) for Watermelon Records, followed by the studio album Switchblades of Love (1993), a collection of songs that proved Young was still potent creatively, if not financially. After releasing Primal Young (2000), he concocted a plan to re-record his back catalogue, since his rights to his original recordings were entangled with various record labels. This resulted in Songlines Revisited, Vol 1 (2005). His latest release was the live album Stories Round the Horseshoe Bend (2007). His son, Jubal Lee, survives him. • Steve Young, singer and songwriter, born 12 July 1942; died 17 March 2016\n",
      "Anthrax's Scott Ian's playlist: Iron Maiden, Fall Out Boy and more The Promise – Sturgill Simpson It’s rare that I like a cover version more than the original. But maybe not so rare when I don’t like the original anyway, as is the case with The Promise. Sturgill Simpson owns this When in Rome song. The heartbreak in his voice is palpable and it gets me every time. Beautiful. The Devil Named Music – Chris Stapleton I’m sticking with the country theme. It’s difficult to pick one song from Stapleton’s brilliant Traveller album, so I picked the one that tells the story of my life. The Phoenix – Fall Out Boy I am a sucker for a good hook, and this is a pure pop gem with a furious urgency. Undeniably catchy and just fucking good. Cowboy Song – Thin Lizzy Phil Lynott was the Cormac McCarthy of hard rock. I have no idea what that means but it feels right. Listen to this song and read Blood Meridian. Purgatory – Iron Maiden I have been a fan of Iron Maiden since 1980. I buy their albums, I buy their merchandise and now I get to go on Ed Force One and tour Mexico, Central and South America with them. Dreams do come true. Thank you heavy metal. • Anthrax’s new album, For All Kings, is out now via Nuclear Blast\n",
      "Getting down with the kids: children review music’s top tips for 2016 My first memory is of music. I’m two-and-a-half, standing on a stool in my grandmother’s kitchen; she has let me help her wash the dishes, which is quite the grown-up honour. I am spinning records in the sink – essentially circling the water with a cleaning brush – because the music on the radio has moved me so much. “Trou-per-per! Trou-per-per!” the song goes, brightly. I am shining like the sun, feeling like a number one. On that dull autumn afternoon, in a small Swansea scullery, began a little girl’s 35-year (to date) love affair with ABBA, and a connection with Super Trouper that would grow through her life (Teens: wow, it’s about touring! Twenties: it’s about the essential melancholy of fame! Thirties: God, how did they all cope doing songs like this while they were divorcing?). Yes, that was me, but what do today’s kids think of pop? Are they more jaded and cynical because they have unlimited access to music? Or do their hearts still burst at the sound of a kick-drum, a synthesiser, a song? I’ve just written a book for young kids called Pop!, about the capacities this music can have, and the things it can do. I did it because I had a baby a few years ago, and felt my relationship to music go through a seismic shift. I wasn’t having much fun: I was often sleep-deprived, and covered with Calpol or dribble, so I’d listen constantly to nostalgia radio stations, seeking out old favourite songs, and singing their lyrics directly, soppily, to my son. An old primary school disco favourite took on a new, rosy glow (thanks Yazz: “The only way is up, baby, for you and me now”). A song I’d first loved on the soundtrack of Dirty Dancing now meant something quite different (bless the Ronettes’ Be My Baby). I wanted to play these songs to my son (now 21 months) because they gave me comfort, of course, but I also wanted to enjoy his primal reactions to them. They took a while, but they came. His first proper, joyful wriggle? To something that I loved in my teens: Future Sound of London’s Papua New Guinea (he’s clearly a raver). One of his first standing-up dances? To the Archies’ bubblegum pop hit Sugar, Sugar (he loves something with a handclap). His first vocal response? To the Beatles’ She Loves You. “Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mammy!”, he said, just the other week. “Yeah, yeah, yeah!” It may sound pretentious, but one of the ideas behind my book was to give pop the credit it deserves as an art form that moves us. As I write in the book, people can use pop “to express their feelings about all the things happening in their lives”. This also went for the way I was feeling. My listening habits in my son’s early months transported me to the easier days of my childhood, but also to pop stars who opened my mind, widened my eyes, pumped my heart – larger-than-life creatures such as Adam Ant, Boy George, and, yes, David Bowie, who took me by the hand, and showed me a wider, bolder world. More than anything, I wanted to let children know that pop, at its best, is about self-expression, and that it “lets you be whomever you want to be”. So what would children make of the crop of 2016’s most-likely-tos, the artists filling all those one-to-watch lists? On a Saturday morning at HQ, I get six- and seven-year-olds Bert, Juno, Xavier, Pearl and Jack to talk to me about pop and rate tracks by five rising stars (results on the panel over the page). Be warned: they’re a discerning bunch of critics. OK, they’re not great at spotting instruments or accents, and things can get a little chaotic (the idea that Jack Garratt was a carrot was a difficult concept to shake from them), but for stinging responses and irreverent comment, they’re your gang. Their tastes are often split on gender lines (dispiritingly common at this age, according to their parents), something also reflected in their favourite songs. The boys all love Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie (“BECAUSE IT’S AWE-SUMMMMM!”, they explain, jumping off their chairs, screaming). The girls adore Katy Perry’s Roar (Juno: “because it’s bouncy” ) and the Frozen soundtrack’s Let It Go (Pearl: “my mum said to me the other day, ‘Can we turn this off now?’”). The girls take the reviewing task seriously, and whisper their ideas to each other. The boys try to impress each other, and affect suspicion of “quiet, pretty music” (although I spot their heads nodding when I’m not looking). Everyone also seems to like music their parents like, which wasn’t always the way for my generation (I liked my mum’s Beatles tapes, but thought David Essex was awful). This panel’s parents had a much broader musical education, though, mainly because of their age. They grew up with acid house and Britpop, hip-hop and heavy metal, and most likely spent their teenage years reading music magazines that taught them, lengthily, about the past. Favourites of the panel today include Björk, the Bangles and Arctic Monkeys. Juno even comes along listening to a Spotify playlist, featuring Steve Miller Band’s The Joker and Cliff Richard’s Devil Woman. But when the children are asked why they like things, they’re not always sure. I was like this at their age: I remember falling in love with Wham!’s Freedom when I was six, without understanding it, only knowing that the bit that went “you know that I’ll forgive you/just this once, twice, forever” put butterflies in my tummy. Years later, I know how that song references Motown, how descending basslines push emotional buttons, and how hugely yearning those lyrics are. But most importantly: those butterflies are still there. While I fondly remember enjoying 60s cassettes in the car with my mum, the sharing of pop between the generations these days is a much bigger deal. My bum-wiggling toddler and I have attended countless classes led by long-suffering musicians with a keen eye on extra income (although watching a room full of babies shake rattles to La Bamba and We Will Rock You is quite fun for parents, admittedly). I’ve also DJed several times for Big Fish Little Fish, the national music and events crew who put on unpretentious “family raves” on Sunday afternoons (their brilliant slogan: “2-4 hour party people”). It is run by ex-senior civil servant, Hannah Saunders, who gave up a 20-year career to set it up, a career change which reminds us that we’ve entered a new age for parenting: one in which mums and dads are allowed to have as much fun as their offspring. Pop is also about dancing, of course, and vivid, physical reactions. This is what I will remember most warmly from our perky pop panel: the arms flailing, the kids windmilling so unguardedly, so joyfully. But I’ll also remember their little reactions about melancholy, and the elaborate, silly stories they concocted, as small songs set off their imaginations in a million directions. By the end of our hour, Pearl and Juno had even decided to form a band and held their first meeting behind an executive chair (“Go away, Dad!”, Juno’s father was told when he tried to take her home). Who knows? In 35 years’ time, they may still have a special memory to relate, and a shared love of certain songs that have changed and grown with them. Either way, they’re super troupers, every one.

I felt there was nothing inside me. Juno: I like the slow bit, middle bit, and the fast! Jack: I hated the start when it was quiet. The loud bit, I liked. Bert: It’s like a snail that goes really slow, then really fast and crashes into a car. Jack: Maybe it’s a snail that’s had fast potion poured on it. Pearl: I like that it stopped for a second, then started again. Jack: She’s angry because she’s shouty. Pearl: She thinks she’s like a boy, because she’s doing lots of shouting. But I like it. Bert: Maybe she’s a girl snail that’s so angry that she jumps into the middle of the Earth and explodes. Pearl: She sounds like she’s in a space rocket and she can’t talk properly, then she’s shouting in space. It’s a bit of a joke, because she was only pretending she can’t speak, so that’s why she shouts. Like this bit!

      "New band of the week: Starchild & The New Romantic (No 100) Hometown: Harlem. The lineup: Bryndon Cook (vocals, music). The background: As though by magic … Of course there’s no substitute for the real thing, but Bryndon Cook, AKA Starchild & The New Romantic, does a fair approximation of 1980s Prince at his most synthy and slow. The 23-year-old New Yorker sings of “rapture” on the opening track to his debut EP, Crucial, but this is exaltation with a side order of sad. It’s almost as though Cook could see what was coming. Listening to the eight tracks on Crucial is like hearing an extended tribute to the purple deity. He even took the title of the EP from a bootleg of studio out-takes apocryphally credited to Prince and Miles Davis. It’s not all Prince worship. Cook grew up loving everyone from Sade to George Clinton. Starchild is partially attributed to a name from P-Funk mythology – something about an alien who arrives by spacecraft to bring the Holy Funk – and nods to Cook’s upbringing in a house across the street from the Nasa Headquarters in Greenbelt. Coming from the state of Maryland also meant exposure to go-go, jazz and gospel (“My roots,” says Cook), though he spent four formative years in Atlanta, home of black futurism (not to mention Future). He continued to look far and wide for other influences: his first mixtape was called Rad! and featured him rapping over David Axelrod and Washed Out. In the last couple of years, he has worked with Solange, Kindness, and Chairlift as touring guitarist, and has collaborated with Dev Hynes. But Prince is his primary influence, and he freely admits it. “I look at him as a whole genre,” he says. “Within the genre of Prince, there is so much to discover.” Like his idol, Starchild played and recorded every note of Crucial on his own, on his laptop. He gives the music a wooziness, like soul with a chillwave gauze (Cook was once an intern at Pitchfork), and keeps it mainly – as we said – nice and slow. There’s a good reason for this: he calls what he does Champion Music for the Heartbroken, describing his songs as “diary entries from the end of my teenage years, where I’m trying to reconcile heartbreak and rejection with escapism”. He adds: “I always appreciated music that lent a helping hand and said, ‘Hey, are you with me? Because I am with you.’ I hope I can do that for someone, somewhere. If I’m lucky.” All My Lovers is like Purple Rain on downers, although as with most soundalikes, the closer you inspect it, the less it sounds like the artist it’s paying homage to, and the more it assumes an identity of its own. Still, this is definitely Prince-like, if not Prince-lite. Slammin’ Mannequin is the one fast song, moving at I Would Die 4 U pace. It sounds as though Cook went out and bought a Linn drum and some of the other equipment Prince used to record his early-’80s output, especially Purple Rain. Listen out for the fiery, fierce guitar solo at the end. Love Interlude features waves of synth while Cook uses his falsetto to impressive effect. Woman’s Dress finds Starchild in self-doubting mood (“Will I ever be enough for you?”), while New Romantic is an object lesson in how to construct the perfect 80s slow jam, all shimmery synths and rubbery bassline. The title track ends the EP as it began, with Starchild lost in a synth murk. It’s as though Cook anticipated the tragic events of 21 April , 2016 before he made this glorious, stately yet sorrowful “computer blue” music. It’s one way to remember Prince. The buzz: “In the style of his personal lodestar, Prince, Cook performed and recorded Crucial entirely on his own.” The truth: Baby, he’s a star(child). Most likely to: Die 4 U. Least likely to: Go crazy. What to buy: The Crucial EP is out now on Ghostly International. File next to: Prince, Dev Hynes, Frank Ocean, Shamir. Links: facebook.com/thisisstarchild. Ones to watch: Globelamp, Kllo, Demotaped, Colour, Charlotte Day Wilson.\n",
      "Yeezus rises: Kanye West releases remix of The Life of Pablo song on Easter Sunday In the latest of Kanye West’s GOOD Friday releases, the artist also known as Yeezus has marked Easter Sunday with an alternate version of his song Ultralight Beam. Ultralight Prayer includes an extended cameo by the gospel singer Kirk Franklin, who was featured on the original version of the song. While Ultralight Beam was about West’s faith in God – including lyrics such as “I’m tryna keep my faith / But I’m looking for more / Somewhere I can feel safe / And end my holy war” – the new version is solely centred around an impassioned prayer by the gospel musician and author, and reads as below: Father, This prayer is for everyone that feels they’re not good enough This prayer’s for everybody that feels they’re too messed up For everyone that feels they’ve said ‘I’m sorry’ too many times Let them know that’s why you took the nail So we could have eternal life If all God’s children would get down on their knees and pray And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again But I won’t make it, God, if you let go of my hand That’s why we need more faith Yes, I’m searching for you, I’m looking for more Yes I am, in your arms is where I feel safe They’re killing our babies in the streets, I call out for war I need just a little bit more of some faith Just a mustard seed, I’m looking for you, for more Prayer for our homes and our families We just wanna be safe Can’t you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear war It’s just the latest extension of West’s new album, The Life of Pablo. The rapper has primarily been using Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal to upload variations of songs on the record (the song below is also available on Soundcloud). West has described the album as “a living, breathing, changing creative expression”, and has periodically added edits of songs such as Wolves and Famous.\n",
      "Alter Bridge: The Last Hero review – exhausting bombast from arena-metal tryhards The main problem with Alter Bridge’s sixth album becomes apparent about six tracks in. Cradle to the Grave brings a few moments of delicate restraint to the party, but up to that point every last second of The Last Hero is purposefully, relentlessly bombastic, as if every fader has been shoved into the red. Still much heavier and more overtly metallic than their modern arena-rock peers, the Florida quartet have always made music designed to resonate around stadia, but 66 minutes of this kind of overwrought caterwauling is a little exhausting. That said, there are great songs here: opener Show Me a Leader is a dark, fiery anthem, The Other Side deftly salutes Metallica’s genre-defining crunch and Crows on a Wire is a fine showcase for guitarist Mark Tremonti’s love of nasty thrash. It falls some way short of 2010’s ABIII – still their best album by some distance – but The Last Hero can hardly be decried as half-arsed. It’s just that there is such a thing as trying too hard.\n",
      "Why Brexit is not music to the ears of British bands touring Europe Europe is closing. “Brexit means Brexit,” reiterates PM Theresa May, buying time until the negotiations for this apparent “hard Brexit” are hammered out. In this political purgatory, businesses are left floundering, unsure about what it will actually mean for them. For British bands touring on the continent, the uncertainty about one of their only certain means of income could not have come at a worse time. It’s not just bands, agents and tour managers voicing worries about the miasma of ambiguity. Sir John Sorrell, the founder of the Creative Industries Federation, has recently argued that touring acts could be driven off the road due to visa and carnet costs in a post-Brexit Europe. (Carnet is a system governing transportation of equipment across borders without having to complete customs declarations on every item, but they could run up to £2,000 a year.) These will all slash the margins of an artist’s primary source of income. Sorrell said the creative sector is “a key driver of wealth and global success” for the UK. “To imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy.” Touring agents and managers that I have spoken to off the record in recent months all revealed enormous uncertainty about what will happen to British acts playing shows and festivals across Europe in the aftershock of Brexit. They are trying to put a brave face on things but most are fearing the worst – namely the closure of opportunities and escalating running costs that could make touring utterly unsustainable. “I think the biggest thing for me as a production manager would be the addition of a carnet for every show outside the UK,” Joel Stanley, production manager at Production Value, told live industry trade magazine IQ in March. “Currently we only ever have to show proof of ownership with the bond and have it stamped in and out if we go outside of the EU – mainly Switzerland – but [post-Brexit we’d need a carnet] even for a one-off show in France.” Agents and touring artists are already dealing with the aftermath of the decline of the CD business. In the boom years, labels would underwrite shows with tour support and regard this as a marketing investment to break new acts that would then go on, ideally, to sell lots of records, thereby covering that development cost. That is now evaporating to the point where 20-date European tours are being truncated to 10 or eight-date jaunts around Europe, with days off a rare thing because days off mean no money is coming in. The net effect could be that acts will just focus on a handful of big European cities – but if they all do that, the shrunken market will quickly become over-saturated and everyone will lose. Add in the possibility of requiring a work visa for every European country and costs could spiral before acts have even played their first show of a European tour. This is already making it hard in other major markets; the same system in Europe could be catastrophic. “Getting visas is an absolute minefield and it costs a lot of money, and it’s the reason that a lot of people don’t get to tour America,” Colin Roberts of Big Life Management told Pitchfork in June. “Even going to a country like Japan where visas are quite easy to get, I know how difficult it is having to factor in the cost and the time to acquire a visa.” The government loves to pay lip service to the export power of British music, braying and gloating from boxes at the Brit awards about how proud they are of our globally successful artists. Britain, since Beatlemania, has been the second biggest exporter of music globally after the US. There is a huge amount of money at stake here for both artists and the UK economy. A study by UK Music this summer found there were 10.4m “music tourists” coming to the UK in 2015 and their direct and indirect spend was £3.7bn. These are people drawn to the UK because of the live market, its successful music exports and its diverse grassroots scenes. On top of this, the BPI reports that British acts accounted for one in seven albums sold globally in 2014, with their record sales generating approximately $2.75bn that year. So there are really two issues here: the outbound earnings of the acts on the road, and the inbound earnings that come from the UK being seen as a global force in music. There is an argument that just because the UK has successfully exported the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Coldplay, Adele and so on, it will just keep doing so forever. It won’t. It needs support and infrastructure at all levels (not just for superstars). It’s an industry truism that the old model of touring as a loss leader to sell albums has been inverted – records are now loss leaders to promote tours. But if you garrotte the touring opportunities, then everyone down the pecking order suffers, and those at the very bottom suffer first and hardest. Couple this with the systematic closure of key grassroots venues around the UK – something the Music Venue Trust was set up as a registered charity in 2014 to lobby against – and things are starting to look very bleak indeed for the future of British live music.\n",
      "Paul McCartney strikes out to gain control of his share of the Beatles catalogue Paul McCartney has begun the process of regaining control of his share of the US publishing rights in the Beatles’ catalogue. The publishing is currently owned by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, but US law allows living artists to apply to take back the right 56 years after initial publication, meaning the Lennon-McCartney catalogue becomes available in 2018. Billboard reports that McCartney began the process to taking control of his half of the Beatles publishing on 15 December 2015. Under the US copyright act of 1976, songwriter must file a claim with the copyright office two to 10 years before the 56 years elapse. McCartney filed a termination notice for 32 songs at the end of last year. However, John Lennon’s half of the publishing – all their songs were credited to Lennon-McCartney, regardless of who wrote them – will remain with Sony/ATV which reportedly made a deal with Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono. The Beatles lost control of their publishing early on. The company Northern Songs was founded by Lennon, McCartney, their manager Brian Epstein and publisher Dick James in 1963, James, however, sold his stake to the UK firm Associated Television (ATV) in 1969, and Lennon and McCartney failed in an attempt to regain their rights. Another attempt by the music manager Allen Klein to set up a deal for the Beatles’ Apple Corps to buy out ATV also failed. Michael Jackson bought ATV Music for $47.5m (£33m) in 1985, which was reputed to have soured his friendship with McCartney, and merged his catalogue with Sony in 1995, for a payment of around £59m, resulting in the formation of Sony/ATV. In 2006, in financial trouble, Jackson struck a further deal with Sony, giving the former the right to buy his half of Sony/ATV. It was finally announced last week that the Jackson estate was to sell its 50% stake to Sony for $750m.\n",
      "Elvis Costello: 10 of the best 1. Less Than Zero That Declan MacManus had been renamed Elvis Costello in the year that Elvis Presley died was merely a stroke of luck. When news filtered through that the King had died, a period of anxiety gripped the offices of the normally publicity savvy Stiff Records, though they needn’t have worried; the seemingly disrespectful timing only added to the withering persona of the new upstart and agitator they were looking to promote. Whether apocryphal or not, the tale that NME were planning on running an Elvis vs Elvis: which one is a Stiff artist? editorial before good taste prevailed makes a good story. MacManus had spent considerable time honing his act with weekly shows at the Half Moon pub in Putney for 50p and a plate of sandwiches in the mid-70s, so by the time Stiff picked him up, he was able to emerge more or less fully formed into the public’s consciousness, a man as erudite as he was angry. His first single, Less Than Zero, was fittingly vituperative, spitting venom at the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, accusing him of engaging in incest to boot (“the song was more of a slandering fantasy than a reasoned argument,” said the author). Mosley had apparently been the subject of a then recent TV documentary in which he reminisced misty-eyed about the Blackshirts. Whether American novelist Bret Easton Ellis had a grip on 1930s British politics or not, he named his first book after the song, and also his last novel to date – the sequel – pluralising Costello’s Imperial Bedroom. Less Than Zero the single is madly catchy and slightly unhinged, and simplistic enough that it fitted in with the burgeoning DIY punk movement; more musically accomplished offerings, like the 1940s-inspired Wave a White Flag, were quietly forgotten about. 2. Radio Radio Perhaps owing more to luck than judgment, Costello assembled one of the finest bands of the late 70s and early 80s in the Attractions, who appeared for the first time on his magnificent, Clash-mimicking first hit single, Watching the Detectives. By the time recording for the album This Year’s Model came around, they were knocking off mod-stomping classics like Pump it Up and (I Don’t Want to Go to) Chelsea in one afternoon with Nick Lowe in the control booth. Another muscular anthem rescued from Elvis’s days in the virtually unheard of pre-punk band Flip City, Radio Radio, was updated in order to bite the hand that fed him. “And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools,” he spat, “tryin’ to anaesthetise the way you feel.” With a sharp hook, a thumping rhythm and Steve Nieve’s trademark swirly organ, the band were able to perform the song on Top of the Pops and sing the words right at presenter Tony Blackburn. The song caused further controversy in the US, when Elvis and the Attractions appeared on Saturday Night Live. Halfway through Less Than Zero the band suddenly stopped and played the prohibited Radio Radio instead. Elvis was banned for life from the show, a banishment that lasted all of 12 years. 3. Oliver’s Army Having grown up a Beatles fanatic, Costello would have been honoured and presumably ecstatic when in 1987 the call came from Paul McCartney to write with him. Perhaps Costello could have imparted some tricks to McCartney, like how to write a protest song, especially regarding British colonialism and the Irish question. Musical genius he might be, but McCartney’s Give Ireland Back to the Irish was one of the limpest musical protests in the history of song, whereas Oliver’s Army was so smart and subversive that many were unaware it was a protest song at all. They just heard the earworm on the radio, joined in with the singalong chorus and lapped up Steve Nieve’s sparkling piano part, which owes a huge debt to Abba’s Dancing Queen, and then they went out and bought it in large numbers. According to Graeme Thomson’s Costello biography, Complicated Shadows, the band had no greater expectation for the song than for it to appear as a B-side when they premiered it at the Roskilde festival in Denmark in 1978. The following year, though, it reached No 2 in the charts, only kept off the top by the Bee Gees and then by Gloria Gaynor. The line “one more widow, one less white nigger” caused little controversy at the time, though when Costello dropped the N-bomb into an argument with Stephen Stills and Bonnie Bramlett at a Holiday Inn in Ohio in March 1979 – he provoked the row, and described Ray Charles as “a blind, ignorant nigger” – it had a disastrous effect on his US popularity. Allegedly high on amphetamines and booze and out to shock, Costello refused to apologise in a press conference for his remarks (his defence at the time was a curt “I’m not a racist”, and he had indeed played Rock Against Racism gigs), but he has been contrite on plenty of occasions since, a transgression presumably high up in his list of regrets. 4. Man Out of Time Whether it was the Holiday Inn incident or just the natural process of growing up, Costello slowly unwound as the 80s gathered pace. He still unleashed unbridled scorn now and again – on Margaret Thatcher on 1989’s Tramp the Dirt Down and on Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas on 1991’s How to Be Dumb – but he also appeared to become more reflective and less confrontational. The phrase “angry young man” uses all three components for good reason, and by the time Costello came to record Imperial Bedroom with Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick in London in 1982, he was approaching 28 years old. “At the time of Imperial Bedroom, I came to terms with the fact that I was sacrificing the power of certain songs to this mad pursuit of tempo,” he later reflected. “Everything had to be delivered forcefully. I don’t know whether it was just a natural process or, literally, cumulative exhaustion of what were very intense years. Man Out of Time is the one time I said, ‘No, stop. Let’s play this at the right tempo.’” Bookended by an earlier noisier version, the song in between seemingly floats on some Dylanesque Highway 61-era Wurlitzer organ, carried along by a noirish narrative about a cabinet minister hiding out from a sex scandal. It also features the amusing rhyming couplet: “H’s got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge / He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege.” Imperial Bedroom is for good or bad a record of maturity, with Man Out of Time the centrepiece around which everything falls. Costello sometimes overreaches, trying to accommodate too much in a song, but not here, somehow. (And when he does, well you can’t fault him for his ambition.) 5. Shipbuilding Another protest song, this time about the Falklands war, Shipbuilding made the connection between a thriving shipyard – a source of working-class pride – and the fact fathers were sending their sons to war and to their deaths. Gritty, humane and deeply moving, Shipbuilding rates as one of Costello’s best lyrics, a fact not lost on the singer himself, who declared it so on several occasions. The music was written by Clive Langer with Robert Wyatt in mind, with the latter recording released on Rough Trade in 1982. Langer also produced Costello’s version when they worked together on the patchy Punch the Clock album in 1983, the song proving to be the highlight. Costello’s version gets the nod over the Wyatt version thanks to the stunning, mournful Chet Baker trumpet solo. “Chet Baker, this wizened corpse on death’s door, strung out, just played,” said Bruce Thomas later. “He followed this bass line and played his solo, so simple, with so much soul in it. It really touched me.” 6. I Want You Artists with a certain desperation are often the ones that impress Costello the most, from Springsteen and Van Morrison to Jeff Buckley, whom he picked to perform at the Queen Elizabeth Hall when curator of Meltdown in 1995 (it was to be Buckley’s last UK performance). Perhaps Costello’s most risque and desperate (on many levels) song is I Want You, a creeping first-person narrative that takes us through a fetid, all-consuming obsession. Sung to the object of the piece, it begins with what sounds like a lullaby, before quickly turning nasty, with the verses scratched out over some dampened chords while the voice barely conceals the anger of belonging to an unwelcome suitor. Each verse becomes a little more desperate, a little more deranged, while each line begins with the words “I want you”, an emphatic refrain that becomes more and more awkward each time he utters it. “It’s knowing that he knows you now after only guessing,” he sings, horrifying and horrified. “It’s the thought of him undressing you or you undressing.” The lyrics and music together are intimately intense, like someone breathing down your own neck, making you shudder, but the melody is irresistible too. 7. Veronica If Costello was the master of smuggling dark subject matter into the charts without most people knowing what he was actually singing about (which actually annoyed him immensely), then 1989’s Veronica might well be the first top 40 hit that broached the difficult subject matter of Alzheimer’s. “She’d talk about who knows what and the next minute it’d be 40 years later,” says Costello, singing on a chair in a now vacant bedroom at the beginning of the video, “so you’d just sit there and bounce around the years with her.” The Veronica in question was his own grandmother Mabel (Veronica was her middle name), and one of his finest, most immediate choruses, becomes a heartbreaker when you scratch a little deeper. Paul McCartney has a songwriting credit on the song, and also contributed Hofner bass (the Attractions had been jettisoned for a revolving door of musicians, as well as frequent contributors such as T-Bone Burnett). The working relationship between McCartney and Costello proved fruitful, and included one album, Flowers in the Dirt, though owing to creative differences related to production, Costello was apparently unhappy with the finished product, and his contribution was eventually somewhat diminished when the record finally surfaced. 8. The Other Side of Summer In 1991 Costello recorded Mighty Like a Rose – which became known as the “beard album”, on account of the fact he grew a beard, which would have been unthinkable in the clean-shaven punk years. Costello, a former computer operator (for Elizabeth Arden in Acton, before he hit the big time), discovered the practical merits of working with computer software whilst writing Mighty Like a Rose, which may explain why so much of the album is cluttered with melodies and yet more countermelodies. On the opening track, The Other Side of Summer, it works though; the song is a sarcastic Brian Wilson pastiche, a spectacular takedown of all things LA, with Costello in biting mood. “From the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf,” he sings cheerfully, “to the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf.” There’s an environmental undercurrent too, and at the conclusion he warns: “Goodnight, God bless, and kiss goodbye to the earth.” Many of the lyrics on Mighty Like a Rose reflect apocalyptic concerns, with Hurry Down Doomsday (The Bugs Are Taking Over) coming across as just plain paranoid. Because of the clutter, the double tracking and maybe the beard, the words aren’t always the easiest to decipher, though whether meanings were conveyed or not, The Other Side of Summer is a nailed-down fantastic tune that belongs in the canon. 9. London’s Brilliant Parade Stick around for long enough in rock’n’roll and proclamations of comebacks are all but inevitable. Costello’s supposed dalliances with classical music with the Brodsky Quartet, and the album Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears penned for Wendy James over a weekend with then partner Cait O’Riordan, had for many detracted from his main body of work. So when he was heard to be back in the studio with Nick Lowe and members of the erstwhile Attractions it was all too much for some. The reviews for Brutal Youth were positive, the “reunion” somewhat overegged, overshadowing what might be Costello’s finest work. Still Too Soon to Know, 13 Steps Lead Down, Kinder Murder, This is Hell, Sulky Girl, You Tripped at Every Step … every one is a classic. London’s Brilliant Parade gets the nod because it’s a beautifully nostalgic love letter to a city that once was, with little trace of Costello’s normally world-wearing irony or malice. The lyrics evoke the plot of a beloved old movie too: “She’s one of those girls that you just can’t place / You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face,” sings Costello, “but of course they knew that when they cast her / Along with the red Routemaster.” Glorious. 10. When I Was Cruel No 2 2002’s When I Was Cruel was supposedly another return to form, or if that wasn’t quite true, it at least resembled the Costello brand. Featuring new band the Imposters, the album also marked a new fascination with looping drumbeats, best exemplified on the epic When I Was Cruel No 2. It is an ambient seven-minute exploration that’s more trip-hop than anything else; looping ad infinitum with a ghostly woman’s voice at the end of each bar that also recalls Gainsbourg and Bardot’s Bonnie & Clyde. When I Was Cruel was released on Def Jam, and his curiosity about hip-hop culminated in a collaboration with the Roots in 2013, with mixed results. Most of the choices in this 10 of the best were selected from within the realms of rock, often at its most straightforward, because despite his obvious abilities, acerbic rock’n’roll is what Elvis Costello does best (whether he likes it or not).\n",
      "How to blag a job in finance: buy some black shoes and ​talk like an aristocrat There’s supposed to be a war for talent. If so, it became pretty clear last week why Britain’s investment banks are losing it. The recruitment filter, revealed in a report from the Social Mobility Commission, works like this: you can only join the customer-facing part of an investment bank if you went to one of four public schools; got a first from one of five universities; and possess “sheen”. Yes, sheen. And polish. No matter how good you are, if your tie is not right or your suit does not fit like a glove, you are destined to take your excellence somewhere else. Little wonder, then, that the world of investment banking suffers from group-think on a scale that crashed the world markets in 2008 and has led to wave after wave of fines for fraudulent behaviour. Given that the signifiers are so clear and obvious, how would you scam your way in? How would you hoodwink the informal process based on “specific behaviours, speech patterns and dress codes”? Unwittingly, the commission’s report provides plenty of clues. First, the obvious don’ts. No beards. Not Muslim ones, not hipster ones, not the stubble worn by movie stars. None. One of the clearest demographic faultlines in the world runs along White Kennett Street, in east London – where the beards of hipsterland begin and the twice-shaven faces of the City end. Also, no brown shoes. In fact, the brown-shoes thing, plus numerous other faux-pas, can be easily avoided by reading GQ magazine. But buy the British edition because if you read the Italian one you are going to arrive in the wrong kind of suit, shoes and – very important, this – socks. I once met a management whizz-kid thrown out of his City internship for wearing plaid socks. You need the haircut, the suit, the shoes, the tie. They are all – like the outmoded economic theories you will have to waffle on about – available as a job lot in and around Savile Row. The suit has to be blue or grey. Sure, you will see electric-blue suits, or pinstripes, on the streets of the Square Mile, but don’t try to pull this off unless your family’s yacht has a helicopter pad. Shoes have to be black leather and click as you strut along a corridor, shutting down venerated retail chains by text message. The bankers surveyed were disdainful of people who “can’t wear a suit”. To their jaundiced eyes, this means you have bought a suit off the peg, and cannot afford six grand to have one made that immobilises you at the armpits and makes your bum look like that of a figure skater. The haircut has to be bouffant. One of the surest signs you have walked into a workplace that recruits only from the elite is that the haircuts do not change. Neat back and sides, big bouffant quiff, no gel, no wax, no putty. These are the marks of convicts or advertising men, not the front-office banker. All this is fakeable, with money, practice, a willing tailor and obedient hair. But then you need to open your mouth to speak. Take careful note of what’s happening to the “posh” English accent. It is no longer enough to have the calm, fruitily inflected RP common among barristers. More fashionable now is the “Rees-Mogg” – a throwback to the accent of the aristocracy in the 1920s, where the consonant “r” migrates slightly towards “w” and even spontaneous utterances sound like they have been written by Michael Gove. This is achievable with practice. Next you need subject matter. The Laffer curve, which attempts to illustrate that taxing the rich is futile, is a good thing to talk about. Also the work of any fashionably rightwing African economist. And Venezuela. If in doubt, diss Venezuela. But – and this is critical – you must understand that words are not the primary medium of communication. If you are going organise a team to fix Libor, you don’t say “let’s fix Libor”. You use subtle understatements, allusions, metaphors, sentences that trail off, eyebrows that curl independently. To learn this you have to hang around in places like St Moritz, and not just for a single season. As to the CV, you must make it up. The four spring internships claimed by elite candidates in their first year at university (the new normal according to the report) come in limited supply. Apart from the sons and daughters of the bankers themselves, most other places will be reserved for the offspring of Arab despots and Russian crooks. And if you are proud of having climbed in Glencoe on your Duke of Edinburgh award, be aware that’s not good enough. You must have, at the very least, discovered a new species in the Amazon while in the lower sixth, or still better, a new tribe. You must have proof of this on Facebook and Instagram. Also references from Nobel prize-winning economists. Fortunately, it’s all fakeable. But here comes the unfakeable part. You must go into that interview not just with a tie from Ede & Ravenscroft and shoes from Lobb. You must go in believing that it is the duty of high finance to avoid tax, rewrite the law of sovereign states, enrich dictators, boost inequality and – in return – voluntarily clean up litter in Haringey on the annual away day. Above all, you must subscribe to the efficient-markets hypothesis so unequivocally that it becomes your religion. This says it’s the job of the financial market to allocate capital efficiently. Centuries of good practice show that capital can only be allocated efficiently when the participants in the deal played rugby with each other at the age of 12.\n",
      "God's Not Dead 2 review – only brief instances of transcendent badness When conversation turns to the entertainment value of the recent “faith-based” films aimed at the US evangelical market, inevitably someone will say: “Nothing tops that Kevin Sorbo one.” The picture in question is God’s Not Dead, an outrageously slapdash, inarticulate movie filled with ludicrous plotting, inelegant staging and one of cinema’s most absurd endings. (The big bad atheist gets hit by a car, just as the Christian rock band Newsboys tells everyone in the audience to text their friends that God isn’t dead.) Shot for only $2m, it grossed more than $60m, enabling its production company, Pure Flix, to release follow-ups such as Do You Believe? and Faith of Our Fathers. But franchises are the thing right now, so it’s not surprising that Pure Flix’s most bankable title would rise again. God’s Not Dead 2 is a much better movie than God’s Not Dead, but that’s a bit like saying a glass of milk left on the table hasn’t curdled and is merely sour. Though the main characters are different, a few of the side players have returned, and once again the big villain is academia – in this case a high school where Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart), a very nice teacher and woman of faith, accidentally trips up and quotes scripture to her students. No reasonable person would ever accuse her of proselytising, but a conversation in her history class on the nonviolence of Gandhi and Dr Martin Luther King also touches upon the teachings of Christ. Wesley specifically says “the author of the Gospels attributes Jesus as saying ...”, but in the paranoid world of Harold Cronk’s film, it’s enough to open up the fires of damnation. Soon (ridiculously soon, if you know how the legal system works, but let’s not get into that) Grace Wesley is on trial. But what is really on trial here? It’s an obvious question, but in case you don’t ask it, you’ll be prompted by a reporter seated in the courtroom who whips out her notebook and writes “What’s really on trial here?” in big letters. It’s that type of movie. She is not just any reporter – she is the liberal blogger from the first God’s Not Dead, Amy (Trisha LaFache), who had advanced cancer but, after meeting the Newsboys, accepted Jesus and is now cured. (No mention is given to the advances of medical science.) The other big connection to the first God’s Not Dead is that one of the jurors is the earlier film’s Pastor Dave (played by Pure Flix’s co-founder David AR White), whose scruffy blonde hair and worldly luck have just enough of that Jesus-is-just-alright-with-me vibe to make him extremely likable. Pastor Dave is calm, welcoming and warm, which is why it’s a bit surprising when God’s Not Dead 2 gets so belligerent in the face of perceived persecution. Dave and other local preachers are forced to turn in copies of their recent sermons to the authorities, “just like in Houston”. This is a reference to a one-off, highly localised subpoena in a 2014 investigation into tax-exempt institutions violating civil rights, that was quickly rescinded. . That context isn’t discussed here. Instead, it’s like Roman times: there is a war over belief, and it is going to take sacrifice to win it. But much like the script of God’s Not Dead 2, we’re letting tangents distract us from the primary story: the trial. Ray Wise practically has a serpent’s tongue as the sleazy American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who wants to destroy this nice, blonde, cardigan-wearing teacher who lives with her ill father (Pat Boone!) and just wants to serve God. There are a number of witness-stand showdowns, such as with the daughter of the atheist parents leading the suit (who has since found Jesus – whoopsie!), and with the scholars who cite theories such as the “unintended eyewitness support system” to “prove” that Jesus’s words were true. (Also, keep your ears open for plugs of Man Myth Messiah, the latest book by Rice Broocks, Pure Flix’s inhouse scribe.) For those looking to get riled up about how evil trends such as diversity are preventing people from believing in Jesus, there’s more than enough red meat in God’s Not Dead 2. For those looking to howl at wretched acting like in Kevin Sorbo’s death scene in the last one, alas, the sequel is a bit of a disappointment. It is unfortunately just professional enough that there are only brief instances of transcendent badness, rather than drawn-out sequences. Instead of a lengthy cameo from a member of the Duck Dynasty clan there is a brief talking-head moment from Mike Huckabee, and the most urgent speechifying here can’t hold a candle to anything in last summer’s surprise hit War Room in terms of church kitsch. The trial scenes go on forever, but despite the two-hour run time, it’s worth staying to the very end. Pure Flix has learned from Marvel, and a post-credits stinger tees up God’s Not Dead 3, whether we’ve prayed for it or not.\n",
      "Deadpool review – crude superhero laughs “A fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break? That’s like… 16 walls.” This relentlessly self-referential antihero romp comes on like a slightly smug corporate riposte to Matthew Vaughn’s altogether more anarchic Kick-Ass, flipping the bird at its own heritage (the opening titles tell us that it’s produced by “Ass-hats” and directed by “an overpaid tool”) and cracking wise about how confusing these comic-strip timelines have become, and the cheapskate nature of the ever-expanding X-Men universe. Ryan Reynolds is the potty-mouthed avenger whose life is ruined when enforced mutation robs him of his Hugo Boss chops, leaving him looking “like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah”. Limb-lopping sweary ultra-violence ensues, offering a fairly consistent stream of dirty cheap laughs as Deadpool gets rear-ended by bullets and butt-plugs alike, while those around him lose their hearts and heads – but mostly their heads. Inevitably the final act descends into the usual punchy/smashy orgy of collapsing buildings that is a dreary franchise requirement. But for the most part it’s crudely disreputable fare, buoyed up by ironic bubblegum tunes (a Guantanamo-style torture montage to the strains of Mr Sandman is a nice touch) and driven by Viz-style “shit biscuit” profanity.\n",
      "Games based on pop stars, yesterday afternoon, a bin, root canals – we review anything The contents of a bin Listen, I’ve sunk pretty low for Review Anything on occasion. For reasons I still do not fully grasp, I once reviewed a woollen ball. I reviewed pegs. Sodding clothes pegs. And yet... this. This is the lowest I’ve sunk on behalf of this feature. Rifling through bins. Here is an image of the contents I uncovered: Here is my review of those contents: The wrapper: I don’t know what this wrapper is for because finding out would mean touching it. It looks crisp, clear and presumably wrapped whatever it was wrapping ably. The tissue: I do know what these tissues are for because I put them in there roughly half an hour before this photograph was taken. The tissues were soft – Sainsbury’s Super Soft Aloe Vera, if memory serves – and smelled very fine indeed. A second wrapper (to left of image): Bananas. This definitely contained bananas. Technically, bananas already come bunched and encased within natural wrappers, so this artificial wrapper seems slightly unnecessary. I would like to add a final note: the bin I reviewed had been emptied fairly recently. Yet more proof that the ’s superlative facilities department is second to none, but not exactly conducive to a thrilling review. The bin’s contents: 4/10 The ’s facilities department: 10/10 LH Computer games based on pop stars The final clause of this suggestion is music to any time-pressed anything-reviewer’s ears, and I’m no exception. Conducting a comprehensive survey of “computer games based on pop stars” would be an actual journalistic enterprise that could potentially involve time and/or effort, so thank God I only had to look at about six pictures before extrapolating some intrinsically worthless judgment. (There was a YouTube video of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood game, but the amount of information contained therein was clearly not just superfluous, but actively contrary to Whitlock & Pope’s requirements. So that’s 22 minutes of my life I still have today.) You might think the more information you have, the easier it is to review anything: not so. In fact, information often complicates the reductive summaries every reviewer longs to write. So what observations can I make about computer games based on pop stars using the limited materials I have at my disposal? Well, the pixels are relatively large. Sometimes they are brightly coloured, sometimes they aren’t. Granted, attributing any sort of value to these observations is not that easy, but that’s why we employ a numerical system! 4/10 RA A chunk of yesterday afternoon 16.24 and all is well 16.25 I think I get a fav on a tweet about how much I hate cars. But then it disappears. 16.25 Someone’s phone goes. It has the Opening (default) ringtone. Every time I hear that ringtone now I always think of the Kanye West song 30 Hours. In that song Kanye is interrupted by the Opening (default) ringtone and he says, “It’s Gabe calling.” When I hear the Opening (default) ringtone I often say “It’s Gabe calling” under my breath. 16.30 The BBC sport website posts “Lawro’s predictions”. This week he has gone head to head with Idris “Heimdall from the Thor movies” Elba to guess the results of this weekend’s Premier League football. Elba backs my team to lose at home against Sunderland on Saturday. I make a mental black mark against his name. 16.41 I start thinking about Corbyn: The Musical, which sounds like a load of self-satisfied rubbish and was written by a barrister with the face of a Victorian pie lover. It’s apparently full of cheap jokes at both the Labour leader’s expense and also, for some reason, prominent twitter feminists. I wonder what made the pie lover feel it was necessary to bring this to the world. 16.48 I google some quotes from The Big Lebowski. 16.53 I think a bit about giraffes and how sticky their tongues are. The sun comes out. 16.54 I think about how I am peckish, but yet not hungry. I wonder what this means. I decide that I have conditioned myself to be in a constant state of need, and that this is a consequence of living in a capitalist system. 16.59 I listen to Strive by A$AP Ferg and Missy Elliott. I can’t decide whether I like it or not. 17.00 I go into a meeting about the redesign of the Guide. It goes OK, but does drag on a bit. Overall this period of time was reasonably stimulating. But the period between 21.24 and 22.17 was to prove more stimulating. 6/10 PM Some dentistry I’m not entirely sure what a root canal is. I know what a canal is and I drank root beer once (mini Review Anything of root beer: vile. -10/10), so perhaps a combination of the two? What I do know is that people who have undergone root canal treatment talk about it in tones more commonly associated with survivors of combat. “You weren’t there, man! You didn’t have to endure what I had to endure.” I’ve always assumed these people were a bit, well, soft. I mean, come on, it’s a tooth. How unpleasant can it… Oh. OH! *runs to Luke’s bin to vomit* I’m so sorry for doubting you and your kind, Chris Adams. From the expletive in your tweet, I gather this was a particularly savage root canalisation, and I hope that you can at least find some inner peace in the future. 1/10 GM Got a suggestion for next week’s Review Anything?

      "Cameron’s cosy Christmas with Murdoch makes you admire Trump’s fighting talk Watch David Cameron start dropping round for seasonal drinks with Rupert and Rebekah again and it almost makes you warm to Donald Trump. The Donald wasn’t endorsed by New Hampshire’s most powerfully portentous newspaper for the coming primary test. The Union Leader is backing Chris Christie via a big front-page message from its publisher, Joseph McQuaid. But Trump doesn’t take it gently, or nip round for a quiet gin and tonic. “You have a very dishonest newspaper here,” he says. “It’s also a failing newspaper. It’s going down the tubes. I remember when this was the big newspaper. Look at the size of this, now. If they cut it down any more, you won’t be able to find it.” As for McQuaid? “I’ve watched this guy and, honestly, he’s a loser.” Pass the peanuts, prime minister. ■ Pundits looking back at 2015 may wonder who got the general election result right. Zilch, nada, humiliation (for everyone up to and including David Cameron). Or who, as Ed Miliband resigned, would succeed him as Labour leader. Nada continued. But at least we can all unite now to blame HMG for its pitiful flood planning and inept reaction to the great rains. As the Daily Express declared last April: “Hosepipe bans and speed showers could become the theme of the summer after experts warn that a drought could take over Britain.” Or, the same dear old Express warned last September: “Four months of heavy snow: Shock UK long-range weather forecast for THIS winter.” Drought, frost, tempest… It makes spotting the rise of Jeremy Corbyn seem a breeze. ■ When I wrote (30 December) about EU referendum deal negotiations, I mentioned different talks between the FT and its journalists’ union over pension changes. FT management wishes me to point out that they, not the new Nikkei owners, are pursuing these “for the long-term sustainability” of the paper – and that while 92% of NUJ members who voted (157 out of 171) wished to enable a strike, 89 other members didn’t return a ballot form. So “only 7% of FT employees” are involved in this dispute. Whether or not that makes for a happy new year we’ll have to wait and see.\n",
      "Clear your diary – the anti-Europe pop gig is off Once more, dear hipsters, to the Brexit concert – or Bpoplive as it is catchily entitled. This is the event scheduled for 8 May at Birmingham’s 16,000-capacity NEC, which the Grassroots Out campaign promised would intersperse Brexit-pushing speakers with some of “Britain’s hottest artists”. Last week, we detailed the personnel issues facing the organisers, as various acts pulled out once they discovered the nature of the event. Alas, I am afraid there is now more bad news for the six political journalists, five sketchwriters, and two recent head trauma victims who are thus far assumed to have bought tickets for it. In short, the concert is no longer taking place on 8 May. Furthermore, the nice lady at the NEC is unable to tell me when it will take place. Bpoplive seems to have gone down over the showbiz Bermuda Triangle. It is unknown whether Phats and Small managed to eject in time. Of course, it’s too early to call off the search entirely. The possibility of the entire event being rescheduled at this notice for another night at the NEC – or indeed another venue, such as a small pub – must not be discounted. Even so, those keen to listen to 90s one-hit wonders with a side order of George Galloway or Mike Read are warned to prepare for disappointment.

      "Led Zeppelin to release expanded version of their BBC Sessions compilation Just when you thought your bank account and shelves were safe, Led Zeppelin have announced another mammoth deluxe reissue, following the complete remastering of their Atlantic Records catalogue over the last few years. This time it’s The Complete BBC Sessions, an upgrade on the BBC Sessions album released in 1997. The unique selling point this time is a third disc, featuring eight previously unrecorded recordings, including a “lost session” the BBC had wiped from its archive – the version of that session comes from a fan’s radio recording. That session includes one Zeppelin song unavailable in any form on any other release, Sunshine Woman (though, naturally, you can hear it in seconds if you search YouTube), which was recorded for Alexis Korner’s Rhythm and Blues programme on the BBC World Service on 19 March 1969. All the sessions were recorded between 1969 and 1971, and feature songs dating up to the fourth Zeppelin album, including a version of Stairway to Heaven recorded on 1 April 1971. Naturally, there is no ordinary edition of the set. The entry-level version is a 3CD or 5LP “deluxe edition”. Those willing to mortgage their houses or sell one of their children’s kidneys can go for the super deluxe box set, with both vinyl and CDs and the additional baubles – a book, a print, a download code. The full CD tracklisting is: Disc One 1. You Shook Me 2. I Can’t Quit You Baby 3. Communication Breakdown 4. Dazed and Confused 5. The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair 6.

      "Matthew McConaughey turns bourbon ambassador and has a quiet night out The warmest of congratulations to cinema’s Matthew McConaughey, whose first opus as “creative director” of Wild Turkey bourbon is already upon us. It was only last month that the bourbon brand announced the Oscar-winning star had signed a multi-year deal to “serve as the chief storyteller for Wild Turkey both behind the camera and in front of it”. I wouldn’t like to hazard how much Wild Turkey Matthew had in him to make the following statement, but it’s good to learn how much of Matthew there seems to be in Wild Turkey. “Wild Turkey has the history and qualities of a brand that depicts the dedication of someone to do something their own way,” he announced solemnly, “even if that way isn’t always the most popular.” Well quite. This is a bourbon still prickly about having spent most of the noughties imprisoned in second-tier romcoms with Kate Hudson, or defending its naked bongo-playing arrest. And so to Matthew’s first commercial distillation of the brand, which is unlikely to win any prizes for originality, given that it opens with him drawling “We’re not in a rush to be most popular …” Well, of course not. It is, after all, an immutable advertising law that dictates this type of hard liquor must always be styled as the laconic choice, the laidback choice, the almost insufferably slow-moving choice. And yet, as anyone who has ever had a proper night on the stuff will tell you, this could scarcely be more at odds with the user experience. The one thing you can bet your pickup truck on is that they’re sweeping up teeth come chucking-out time in Jack Daniels Hollow, where a mere naked bongo arrest must surely be regarded as having had a quiet one.\n",
      "Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone musical La La Land to open Venice film festival Whiplash director Damien Chazelle’s musical romance La La Land is set to open this year’s Venice film festival. The film reunites Crazy, Stupid, Love stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and is pitched as a tribute to Hollywood’s golden age of musicals but will have a contemporary setting. It will premiere in competition on 31 August. This year’s jury will be headed up by Sam Mendes. Gosling will play a jazz pianist who falls for Stone’s aspiring actor but the two face problems when they become more successful. JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for his role in Whiplash, and the singer John Legend also star. “La La Land is a film that does not merely reinvent the musical genre, it gives it a brand new start,” said Alberto Barbera, Venice artistic director, in a statement. “If Whiplash was the revelation of a new filmmaker, La La Land is his definitive, albeit precocious, consecration among the great directors of Hollywood’s new firmament.” Last year’s festival was opened by the survival drama Everest, which received middling reviews and box office, but previous years have seen Oscar winners Birdman and Gravity kick things off. The 31-year-old Chazelle made his name with the acclaimed drama Whiplash, which won three Oscars and was nominated for two more, including best picture. He also co-wrote the hit sci-fi thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane. Gosling was most recently seen in action comedy The Nice Guys and will next be seen in Terrence Malick’s Weightless as well as Blade Runner 2. Stone was last seen in Cameron Crowe’s comedy Aloha and has recently completed Battle of the Sexes, where she plays Billie Jean King.\n",
      "Dancing to the Coen brothers’ tune: Channing Tatum on his role in Hail, Caesar! Seemingly force-fed into sailors’ whites, Channing Tatum’s first appearance in a Coen brothers film has already triggered dropped jaws across the world. Tip-tapping his way across the screen, Tatum makes good use of his dance skills as the star of an On-the-Town-ish film-within-a-film, one of several that punctuate Hail, Caesar!, which is set mostly within the confines of a single Hollywood studio in the early 1950s. The homoerotic subtext is never far from the surface of Tatum’s scenes, and Hail, Caesar! gets lots of yuks out of it. “People now can’t believe it,” says Tatum. “The 50s were very square and conservative, but audiences loved these guys. The dancing is so elegant and dainty, but guys on the street would love it without irony. It’s such a fascinating juxtaposition that 50s men could like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. All that “I’m gonna dance with you, pal” type stuff.” Casting Tatum was bit of a masterstroke on the Coens’ part, in keeping with their tradition of big-name cameos. But Tatum is something of a conundrum: he may look like a jock, but his willingness to hoof it up on film – from Step Up to Magic Mike – has been instrumental to his success. “There’s not a lot of actors that dance, I guess,” he says, “though I have never actually danced like this. When we started, the Coens weren’t sure if they wanted it to be tap dancing, but they did know they wanted it to be Gene Kelly-esque and athletic. Originally, it was going to be on a battleship, with me running up the sides, me on a big huge gun. But then it started to change to a tap dancing and singing thing. That I was really panicked about, but it worked out OK.” Tatum is a highly rated actor these days, thanks to an astute association with a string of auteurish American directors alongside his more obviously commercial romcoms and action movies. He has made three films with Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike, Haywire, Side Effects), Foxcatcher for Bennett Miller, Jupiter Ascending with the Wachowskis and, most recently, The Hateful Eight with Quentin Tarantino. “I’ve been really blessed to work with so many different types of director. It’s fascinating. The way the Coens work is really precise, and they really try to bring you into the process. We get pages every morning, and on the back is the entire storyboard for the scene. But, within that, you can try anything, they don’t lead you that way. With Quentin, he’ll give you a note that is so specific: I want you to pick this up on the first syllable, I want you to walk all the way across the room, set it down, then say the last syllable. It’s just different styles. Everyone has their way.” • Hail, Caesar! is released in the UK on 4 March.\n",
      "Spotlight review – Catholic church called to account over child abuse Spotlight is a movie of clarity and force: the true story of the Boston Globe’s “Spotlight” team and its 2002 campaign to investigate a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. Its value was obvious at the Venice film festival last year, but it has grown in my mind since: what seemed like a plodding pace is actually a shrewd approximation of the steady drumbeat that effective reporting creates. This is what the police work of investigative journalism looks like: the documents, the phone calls, the pre-web clippings, the expense of shoe leather in going out to interview people who don’t want to be interviewed. Spotlight doesn’t have the sensational thrills of Alan J Pakula’s All the President’s Men (1976), or for that matter David Fincher’s Zodiac (2007). And there are a few journo cliches. But it has the sinew of a really good procedural, underpinned by genuine moral outrage. Michael Keaton plays veteran reporter Walter “Robby” Robinson, working alongside hot-tempered Mike Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo, and Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, who has an extraordinary scene when she persuades an abuser-priest to come to the door and talk. Boston was a clubbable world in which a smile on the golf course, or a pat on the back and a meaningful look at the church social was enough to enforce silence. It takes a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) – non-Boston, non-Catholic – to shake things up and insist on doing the child abuse story properly, and paradoxically reveal the paper’s own former shortcomings. The film has real insights to offer: the cast powerfully convey the journalists’ horror at realising the abuse stretches back decades or even centuries and also how abuse is as much about power as sex and that homosexuality is beside the point: the abusers have evolved the choice of boy victims because boys are reticent, more likely to swallow their shame and not speak out. A powerful story.\n",
      "It’s Twitter’s 10th birthday. So do you love it or hate it? Abi Wilkinson: ‘Twitter has allowed us to break into what seemed a closed shop’ In 2009 I was lonely. I’d moved to a brand new city to start university and my boyfriend had decided to come with me. I found my study fascinating, but outside of three weekly hour-long seminars I had little access to people to discuss it with. When my boyfriend came home from work the last thing he wanted to do was dissect the finer points of political theory. He was also suspicious of my desire to make new friends and I eventually gave up on trying to socialise. Desperate to occupy my time, I created a Twitter account. It turned out to be exactly what I needed. Quickly, I became part of a community who chatted about all the same things I wanted to talk about. I could debate with Adam Smith Institute employees about Lockean property rights or argue with social conservatives about the broken windows theory. I had a new network of friends to natter about everyday things with. While my mates from home were busy drinking and flirting, I knew I could always go online and find someone to gossip and joke with. When I was feeling down, there would be someone there to lend a sympathetic ear. My relationship fell apart and I eventually threw myself into university life, but I didn’t break the Twitter habit. I had friends on the other side of the world who knew more about my daily thoughts, feelings and concerns than anyone I’d ever been in a room with. When I finished university, it was Twitter that helped me find my first graduate job working for Trinity Mirror. I’d written a blog about a bad experience at the jobcentre so everyone knew I was looking for work. A friend directed my attention towards a tweet advertising a paid internship and pestered me to apply. Somehow, miraculously, I was offered a two-week trial. If you’d asked me back in 2009 if I could imagine myself working in the media, I’d probably have laughed in your face. Many of the same people I remember tweeting with back then have jobs at newspapers and magazines. Twitter has allowed us to break into what seemed a closed shop. Obscure blogs can generate as much conversation as broadsheet leaders. It’s possible to catch the eye of commissioning editors even if you have no formal credentials. Looking back, it’s hard to imagine what my life would be like if Twitter had never existed. Maybe I’d have flunked out of university. Perhaps I’d still be stuck in an unhappy relationship. Certainly, I doubt my career would have gone the way it has. On the 10th birthday of the social network, I suppose it’s really about time I said thanks. Steven Baxter: ‘I’m stuck in a toxic relationship with a little bird icon’ Twitter is a sickness. I’m stuck in a toxic relationship with a little bird icon on my telephone. I need help – and so do you. I loved that little tweety bird once. I craved the gold sticker of a retweet or the pat on the head of a favourite. I tried everything – puns, hashtag games, memes, pretending to know about American politics – just for the thrill of being read by a stranger. But it all got too much. There are many bad things about Twitter – from the open sewer of racism and abuse to the horrendous blue-ticked cliques squawking at each other, from snarky subtweets to heartbreaking unfollows from people you like – but if I could pick one downside as the worst, it would be the Plague of Angry Eggs. At first, when you have a relatively popular tweet (say more than 25 RTs), it’s exciting. You’ve made it. “I once got retweeted by a minor celebrity!” you tell your friends – if you have any left now that you’re staring at the people in your telephone every 10 seconds. Then reality kicks in. Tweeting can be like dangling your meat-smeared genitals through the bars at the zoo and whistling cheerily at the ravenous wolverines. The Angry Eggs take issue with what you’ve said, a particular word, your choice of profile picture or a grammatical error, and your joy is over. Hatred and finger-wagging pollutes your @-mentions. You tweeted something six years ago that contradicts your tweet! Aha! I managed a Twitter flounce, once, loudly announcing I was leaving the party and attempting to cause a scene. No one particularly noticed. “Real” life carried on and was rather refreshing without constantly having to tell the people in my telephone every thought in my head. But I needed my fix. I sneaked back. I blocked all the irritants I could think of – your Hopkinses, your Blunts. I deleted all tweets every two weeks, but that wasn’t enough. I tried to keep my thoughts to myself as much as possible and stop craving retweets and likes. But I couldn’t help myself. The Plague of Angry Eggs was still there as well, and in greater numbers. My nemesis. Just waiting in the shadows for me to say something in order to disagree with it without reading it properly, or wilfully misunderstand the point of a joke. And yet, I just can’t seem to quit.\n",
      "Cult heroes: Betty Wright – soul's golden agony aunt Betty Wright was a little late for the 60s heyday of Motown, Stax and Atlantic, but she wasted no time catching up. Her first album was released in 1968, when she was only 14; she had her first pop hit when she was 17; she earned her first gold record when she was barely 18 – all despite coming from a religious family that refused to allow anything other than gospel to be played at home. Looking back on her childhood in an interview in 2012, she said she managed to persuade her mother to bless her nascent pop career by also being an A student who “did all the right things in school”, as if being musically precocious wasn’t enough of an achievement. In those early records, there’s an amusing disjunction between Wright the youthful singer and the put-upon female characters she portrays. In Babysitter – one of the first songs she wrote herself – a woebegone mother warns women not to trust any “16-year-old schoolgirl” around their husbands, and it sounds perfectly reasonable until you remember that Wright herself was still in her teens. She is the queen of the cautionary tale and practically an agony aunt when it comes to dispensing relationship advice, but she should be approached with caution unless you want a scolding administered along with tissues and gin. Secretary is clear on whose fault it is if a man has a work affair: the secretary “takes the time to listen / To what he has to say / While all you do is nag him / A thousand times a day.” In the entry on Wright in the Rough Guide to Soul and R&B, Peter Shapiro expresses reservations about Wright’s first hit, Girls Can’t Do What the Guys Do: for him it’s “a strange record given Wright’s assertive catalogue, and it sounded as though she was fighting with the chauvinistic lyrics”. And yet the line she takes – that girls can’t sleep around, or attempt to revenge a boyfriend’s misdemeanours, “and still be a lady” – is of a piece with so many of the songs in her catalogue. In the late 80s she released the “Pain trilogy”, a sequence of songs reflecting on the ups and downs of a long relationship, which have a similar core of conservatism. In No Pain (No Gain), for instance, she explains “something you young girls might not understand” – that love requires work, commitment and forgiveness, and “a little bit of pleasure’s worth a whole lot of pain”. Even when she bosses men around, she does so with solicitude for them and an eye on women’s responsibility: in Love Don’t Grow on a Love Tree, from her brilliant 1974 album Danger High Voltage (such a perfect title), she tells a two-timing man that he can’t have “every woman you see” – but can’t help herself hoping “you get just what you need”. And on her 2011 comeback album The Movie, in a duet with Snoop Dogg called Real Woman, she instructed all the young men in her life: “Get yourself a real woman” – no gold-diggers, basically; women willing to do the work/commitment/forgiveness thing – “so you can be a real man”. There are a lot of young men – and women – in Wright’s life because, as she told the online magazine Soul and Jazz and Funk, she’s the “mamma-sister-auntie-cousin type of woman”. Instead of a “diva type” driven by the desire for fame and awards, her energies are focused on supporting other singers and musicians. Joss Stone – another absurdly precocious teen star – is one of her most high-profile mentees, and Wright was nominated for a Grammy for her co-production work on Stone’s 2004 album Mind, Body and Soul. But there are plenty of others, and even a “songwriting camp” Wright set up called the Most, abbreviated from Mountain of Songs Today (equals Mountain of Songs Tomorrow). “I want to inspire people to write,” she told her local newspaper, the Miami New Times, in 2012: write, that is, as opposed to sample, a practice that receives seriously short shrift in the opening track from The Movie, Old Songs. “What you gonna listen to,” she demands, “if you ain’t making nothing new?” A diligent businesswoman, Wright has taken people to court for not paying royalties when they sampled her records, and in 1985, noticing that men in the music industry tended to be paid more readily than she did, set up her own record label to ensure she would never have to fight for what she had earned. Three years later, she used it to release her album Mother Wit, winning a gold record in the process. Mother Wit opens with two of the Pain songs, but maybe a better signature tune is Ms Time: “I wait on no man,” Wright shrieks with relish, “you wish that I stand still for you.” Across her career what you hear is a mixture of take-no-crap assertiveness and hard-won acceptance, belligerent attitude and genuine kindness. In an interview from 2012 with Blues & Soul magazine, she talked of how important it is that music “helps you get from Monday to Tuesday” and gives its listeners hope. She focuses on romance, she said, to communicate the message that “no matter how bad the economy gets, as long as I have you here we can live in a tree! You know we can go out and bathe in the lake if we have to, but if you are with me and I am with you, we can do this. I think those are songs that people need to hear now,” and she’s right, we do.\n",
      "Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham Oh what might have been. On an afternoon when Tynesiders devoted virtually the entire 90 minutes to imploring Rafa Benítez to stay on as Newcastle United’s manager next season his previously underachieving team belatedly remembered they could actually play a bit. In the process Aleksandar Mitrovic created one goal, scored another and was sent off for a truly appalling challenge as Tottenham Hotspur’s chances of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995 were shredded. Mauricio Pochettino’s players needed only a point to finish second but ended up third and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next season’s Champions League. Any Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next season’s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this? While Benítez’s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenham’s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race. At other times, on other days, St James’ Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the “Keep Rafa” agenda. It meant that, rather indulging in “sack the board” chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: “Rafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.” Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. “Rafa Benítez, Rafa Benítez,” fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead. Spurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia striker’s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchman’s 10th goal of a season he had started so brightly before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump. Fortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of “Stand up if you love the Toon,” before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a small aeroplane circling the skies above them trailing a large banner bearing the message: “Auf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.” It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense – there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of £1,000. As if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Lloris’s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksen’s fierce shot. As the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free Érik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net. If Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for England’s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko. This being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastle’s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissoko’s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksen’s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot. Buoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal. Turning creator, Aarons’s pass then picked out the overlapping Janmaat whose low shot defied Lloris. St James’ Park reverberated to a by now familiar theme. “We want you to stay,” they roared. “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Man of the match Gini Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)\n",
      "Anderson Paak: ‘If Dre had called five years ago, I don’t think I’d have been ready’ I’d be lying if I told you that my interview with Anderson Paak gets off to a flying start. The reality is anything but. The 30-year-old rapper and singer-songwriter from Los Angeles is ushered into my cramped hotel room in Salford looking like death warmed up. He’s battling a nasty flu virus that threatens to derail his European tour. While I do my best to be solicitous, his eyelids droop and he barely speaks. Fearing disaster, I quickly phone for black coffee and, fortunately, it does the trick. He may not be a household name just yet, but Paak is well on the way to becoming one. For a start, he is making some of the most exciting new music around. His sound is a warm and hazy blend of styles – funk, jazz, New York house, reggae, trap, blaxploitation-era soul, a hint of psych-rock – anchored in R&B and hip-hop. He is equally at home singing and rapping. And he has a highly distinctive voice that somehow manages to be both smooth as maple syrup and raspy as a whisky-soaked barfly. Comparisons have been made with Frank Ocean, André 3000 and Innervisions-era Stevie Wonder. Significantly, Paak has also been recently anointed as Dr Dre’s latest protege. The hip-hop mogul and Beats headphones founder has a habit of picking winners, from Snoop Dogg to Eminem, and Paak signed a deal with Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment in January. This followed on from his star turn last August on Dre’s comeback album, Compton. Paak co-wrote and sang on six of the songs, more than any other guest – including Snoop and Eminem, as well as other heavy hitters, such as Ice Cube and Kendrick Lamar. This was a remarkable achievement because at the time Paak was virtually unknown. He had independently released an album, Venice, in late 2014, which won widespread critical acclaim but made little mainstream impact (although it was championed by Gilles Peterson on Radio 6). Paak also had a project called NxWorries, a collaboration with the hip-hop producer Knxwledge – their single Suede went viral in early 2015, and came to the attention of Dre, who apparently played it for weeks before getting one of his A&R team to call Paak and invite him to audition. That must have been quite a moment. Paak flashes a toothy grin and perks up immediately. “When I finally met him, for some reason I didn’t have any super-fanboy jitter thing, where I couldn’t be myself,” he says. “I was so confident by that point I just said: ‘Let me get on the mic and try something.’ And I remember closing my eyes and going off the top, and then opening them and it was like, ‘Whooaaaahhh!!’” He mimes Dre throwing his hands up in the air in appreciation. It probably helped that Paak had already had a lot of practice by the time he met Dre. “If he’d called five years ago, I don’t think I’d have been ready,” he admits. Paak is his real name, by the way. But as an artist he prefixes it with a full stop – .Paak. It’s a weird affectation, but he tells me it symbolises attention to detail. It’s a reminder to himself to stay on top of his game because he hasn’t always done so. “I thought things would just fall into my lap,” he says. “So I’d put my career in the hands of just about anybody. And before I knew it I was in my late 20s, and things just weren’t sticking. Plus, in LA image is more than half the battle, and I was just a music nerd who never gave a fuck about image.” Indeed. For most of his 20s he recorded under the name Breezy Lovejoy. “I didn’t always take myself that seriously,” he admits. “Image-wise, I was somewhat of a jokester.” The first thing he put online as Lovejoy was a Coldplay tribute. “I didn’t really know what I was doing,” he says. Eventually it was fatherhood – his son, Soul, is now five years old – that gave him the wake-up call he needed. Since then, he has ditched the cringy Lovejoy alias, stepped up his songwriting game, and independently released two dazzling albums – Venice and, more recently, Malibu in January. Like generations of African American musicians before him, Paak laid the foundations for his career during childhood in church. It was where he learned to play drums, tutored by kindly older musicians who recognised that he had talent; the singing and rapping came later. “If you grow up playing in church, it removes a lot of the boundaries that other musicians might have, growing up with sheet music or whatever,” he says. “It’s like [adopts booming preacher’s voice] you’re dealing with the Holy Spirit! God’s working through your hands!” The church was in Oxnard, a small city 100km from Los Angeles. Brandon Paak Anderson and his three sisters (two older, one younger) were born and raised there, in a mostly white suburb. Church was a focal point for Oxnard’s fragmented black community; his short-lived first marriage at 21 was to a girl he met there. Paak’s mother is mixed race: half-black, half-Korean – he has her eyes. She was orphaned during the Korean war, and adopted by a US soldier who took her back to America and raised her with his family in Compton. His father, meanwhile, was an identical twin from Philadelphia, an air force man who was discharged for drugs – and who ended up severely addicted to both drugs and alcohol, with traumatic consequences. “He went to prison for assault and battery of my mum,” Paak says, with calm detachment. “I witnessed him beating my mum. He beat her within an inch of her life. We called the cops and he went to prison for 14 years [he was also found guilty of firearms offences]. I never saw him after that. I talked to him a little bit, but the next time I seen him he was being buried.” Paak was seven years old when he saw the beating. How do you process something like that? “I don’t know. It’s had an effect, but I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it did. I know I have some issues… maybe if I see a therapist they can tell you!” His mum is clearly a resilient woman who had a flair for business. She took over a small strawberry stall in Oxnard from a friend, and built it into a large organic strawberry company, supplying grocery stores and restaurant chains. She remarried, and “life got very good – we went from living in a one-bedroom apartment to a five-bedroom mansion by the time I was in high school. I had everything I wanted growing up, though all I wanted was music stuff – drums, a PC, turntables. They supported me with all of that.” But their luck changed again: unusually heavy rainstorms linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon ruined the strawberry crops for two consecutive seasons, “and everything went to shit. Mom had to file for bankruptcy. But during this time, she also developed a healthy gambling habit. We were in Vegas every weekend. My mom and step-pops were really good, and when you’re really good at gambling, you don’t pay for anything. Everything was on the house. We’d get all our meals free, all the room service. I’d bring my friends from school. It was just crazy rooms, dude – TVs coming up out of the floor and shit…” And then that all went wrong, too. His mum and stepdad were arrested and charged for not declaring their winnings, and for “illegally moving securities”. Paak was 17 and knew nothing; he is sketchy about the details even now. “They were making a bunch of money at the tables and not notifying the government – Mom was actually using it to pay back what she owed from the bankruptcy. But when people found out that she had paid others back but not them, they reported her.” His mum served seven and a half years of a 14-year sentence. Around the same time, it emerged that his stepdad had been having an affair, and was having a child with another woman. “I never really liked him anyway,” Paak shrugs. “When my mom went under, everything collapsed. Like, before that we were just spoilt brats. My mom paid for everything. My two older sisters were married with families of their own, but they were still being taken care of. One of them had to move back into the house to take care of me and my little sister – but then the house got foreclosed, so we had to get out.” He has only recently felt able to write about all this – and the years of hard living and family fallouts that followed. There is little sign of it on his light-hearted first album, Venice. But its game-changing follow-up, Malibu, is a much deeper proposition, full of long-buried and painful childhood memories, transformed into bittersweet melodies and woozy, punch-drunk raps. “Is you gonna smile when your date gets issued? You know them feds taking pictures/Your mom’s in prison, your father needs a new kidney/Your family’s splitting, rivalries between siblings/If cash ain’t king it’s damn sure the incentive/And good riddance,” he raps on The Season/Carry Me, one of the album’s many highlights. “I guess it just took time,” he says. “I don’t think I knew before how to properly express what I had gone through in song form. I’m glad I didn’t try to force it before I was ready. Also, it’s part of my personality to be light; I’m more about lightness than anything.” He clearly has a lot to tell. And I’m not sure we’ve heard the half of it yet. Not because he is holding back; in fact, quite the opposite. He is such an enthusiastic raconteur that each question elicits lengthy answers, rich in plot twists and biographical minutiae, and in the end we run out of time. His final tale is about the period he spent working on a weed farm. He begins with: “So my [second] wife came in from Korea and she got pregnant…” and progresses into how, in his desperation to make money, he landed the weed farm job through a fellow musician. Marijuana for medical prescriptions has been legal in California since 1996. “I remember looking out over the hills, and there were football fields of the shit, as far as you could see,” he says, before giving me a thorough briefing on how to chop, trim and bag “all these huge plants – bigger than you! It was the hardest work of my life, but it was 150 bucks an hour. We were there for ever…” He’s still telling me about the weed farm when there is a knock at the door – I don’t have time to ask how much of the grass, if any, he smoked himself (his music certainly has a spaced-out quality). Nor to ask about the period of homelessness he and his pregnant wife endured after he was suddenly let go from the weed farm job – and which only ended after he was taken in by Shafiq Husayn, of the alternative hip-hop group Sa-Ra, who put him up until he had finished his Venice album. Our time is up. He has to leave for his gig at Manchester’s Ruby Lounge. I saw him deliver a high-octane show in London a night earlier. His performance was spectacular, deftly switching between singing and rapping, accompanied by his hipsterish backing band, the Free Nationals. Sadly, tonight’s show turns out to be his last of the tour – the flu forces him to cancel the rest. But the tour has nevertheless been a success. The venues have been modest, but each sold out. And bigger shows will follow in the wake of the recent deal with Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment, guaranteeing the future backing of one of the most powerful men in music. But for now there’s something gratifying about watching an artist whose success has been gradual and hard-won. His tale is a salutary reminder that even in the internet era, it can still be a long way to the top. Is he dreaming of even bigger things now? “You gotta dream!” he grins. “But I’m still very much aware of what’s going on right now. I’ve done a bunch of shitty club work playing drums for other people, and now I’m on tour – with a whole van! Full of our shit! Our merch, our equipment… our show!” And with that, R&B’s newest and least pretentious star heads off to inject some lightness into the Salford gloom. He’s living the dream already. Malibu is out now on Steel Wool/OBE/Art Club. Anderson .Paak plays the Wireless festival, Finsbury Park, London N4 on 10 July and the Reading/Leeds festival on 27-28 August; ticketmaster.co.uk\n",
      "Deadpool; Bone Tomahawk; Heart of a Dog; Nasty Baby; Alan Clarke at the BBC – review Superhero films, in all their Lycra-wrapped machismo, are easy enough for sceptics to mock; once the film-makers join in, however, a strained sense of regimented fun creeps into proceedings. So it is with Deadpool (Fox, 15), an eager but terminally smug exercise in self-aware Marvel prankery that leaves no fourth wall undemolished. Starring Ryan Reynolds as an ex-military victim of medical experimentation left with superhuman healing powers and super-irksome wisecracks, Tim Miller’s film follows the Kick-Ass course of self-covering provocation: sadism or sexism with a wink, it reasons, isn’t sadism or sexism. (Deadpool’s girlfriend may be a colourless stock figure, but she does get to sodomise him. Feminists, you are hereby appeased.) It feigns offensiveness, though only those appalled by hormonal schoolboys need take umbrage. Credit where it’s due to Reynolds, who sells the whole thing with smarm and charm that aren’t mutually exclusive, but this is a glib, greasy idea of fun. For violently funny subversion of Boy’s Own fare, look instead to Bone Tomahawk (The Works, 18), S Craig Zahler’s splendid, morbid revival of the cowboys and Indians western. The palefaces’ enemy this time is a fantastical tribe of mutant cannibals (“Men like you wouldn’t distinguish them from Indians,” one Native American character pointedly observes) who kidnap some local townsfolk, setting sheriff Kurt Russell and his motley crew off in hard-squinting pursuit. Zahler has an adoring eye and ear for the idiom of Hollywood’s old west, with a salty, satirical streak that frankly outclasses Quentin Tarantino’s recent strain of pastiche. The film then thrillingly jackknifes into fresh, bloody B-movie terrain, yet even at its most viscerally grisly points, Zahler’s limber, literate way with language never deserts him: listen out especially for the sublime Richard Jenkins’s monologue about circus fleas. As beguiling as it is utterly classification-resistant, Laurie Anderson’s roving personal essay Heart of a Dog (Dogwoof, E) got a tad lost in cinemas last month, but should be cherished on small screens. Beginning as a grief-stricken Valentine to the film-maker’s late terrier, it unrolls with graceful imprecision into a meditation on narrative, music, philosophy, even the paranoia of post-9/11 America. Its cobweb connections make far more sense seen than described. Simpler in its sweetness is Our Little Sister (Curzon, PG), an unashamedly small tale of sibling bonds lost and found that accrues power with its accumulation of fine domestic (and fragrantly culinary) details. It’s less preoccupied with emotional escalation than some of director Hirokazu Koreeda’s more acclaimed works, and more moving for it. Far more acrid human observation is to be found in Chilean-American auteur Sebastián Silva’s Nasty Baby (Network, 15), in which a gay couple’s attempt to conceive a child with a female friend (Kristen Wiig) goes off course via a neck-snapping plot twist that I found at once exhilarating and unconvincing. Reissue of the week, by a long yard, is Dissent & Disruption: Alan Clarke at the BBC (1969-1989) (BFI, 18), a mammoth compilation of the gut-spilling social realist’s collected TV dramas, alongside his feature films Scum and The Firm, here presented in a new director’s cut. The total comes to 13 discs, 33 hours and more than a hundred quid; an investment for the committed, not the curious. I’m still working my way through, but it’s a stunning assembly: the cleaned-up transfers haven’t lightened the dirt under these films’ nails one bit. Finally, you have just over two weeks left to head to Mubi.com and stream the year’s most dizzying swirl of cinema so far: Miguel Gomes’s Arabian Nights trilogy, a bounding, incandescent triptych of films themselves composed of profuse interlocking parts, addressing history, mythology and contemporary European economics through its own eccentric version of Scheherazade’s storybook. There are chaffinches and ghost dogs here; Gomes juggles personal and political grievances here, finding room for love, law and Lionel Richie. At over six hours, it sounds imposing, but proves a leisurely, enveloping wallow.\n",
      "Sacha Baron Cohen has trashed Grimsby – but these places had it far worse After painting Kazakhstan as an atavistic hole of Jew-haters, inbreeders and clock-radio coveters in Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen is poised in his new film to besmirch the reputation of Lincolnshire’s most self-flagellatingly named estuarial port town, Grimsby. Chav Central seems to be the keynote. No one in current cinema trashes a place quite like Baron Cohen – but there have been plenty of outstanding demolition jobs, like the 10 below. Merely kitchen-sink or “authentic” treatments didn’t cut it for the list – contenders had to demonstrate actual malicious, distorting and/or resident-slandering intent. The Australian outback (Wake in Fright) The Aussie wastes are always foreboding on film. But they become a perpetually hungover, exit-less purgatory in this 1971 Ozploitation classic in which a schoolteacher en route to Sydney gets waylaid in the mining town of Bundanyabba (AKA “the Yabba”). The sickening amount of West End lager consumed amid the endless gambling sessions and kangaroo pogroms ranks as the most counterproductive example of product placement ever. Georgia, USA (Deliverance) Come to Georgia! Tackle the thorny hillbilly accent! Pit yourself against ominous banjo-playing idiot savants! Step into the wilderness and find yourself the sexual plaything of devious, dentally challenged mountain men! Bizarrely, John Boorman’s anti-tourist board ad actually increased interest in the southern state, sparking a whitewater rafting boom on the Chattooga river for those coming to hear the surrounding hills echoing with the sounds of evil redneck chuckling. Chinatown, everywhere (Chinatown) No one is denying that Chinatowns worldwide have the odd problem with organised crime and food-standards violations. They didn’t ask, though, to be made into some kind of international byword for total spiritual perdition. Orientalists everywhere thrilled to the climax of 1947’s The Lady from Shanghai when Orson Welles’ protagonist is spun around in front of Asian eyes (inscrutable, of course). But, setting PI Jake Gittes on a similar trajectory, Roman Polanski’s 70s Los Angeles masterpiece takes the misfortune cookie. Message: “Your grandad’s also your dad.” The Scottish Highlands (Breaking the Waves) Like Colorado in Dogville, Lars von Trier gives the impression of never having set foot in the real north of Scotland, lest it complicate a picture-postcard conceptual backdrop for his favourite hobby: subjecting his lead character to a set of directorial ordeals. The stony-faced Calvinist elders and feral schoolchildren who prowled the land and dead-eyed rapey sailors lurking offshore were supposedly from the 1970s. Were it not for Emily Watson’s PVC skirt, the red phonebox, and Bowie and Elton on the soundtrack, you’d have mistaken it for the 1770s. Swansea (Twin Town) Renton and crew operated in Edinburgh’s margins, but the leering, droog-eyed brothers at the heart of the “Welsh Trainspotting” are practically mascots of a “pretty shitty city”. Kevin Allen’s Swansea is a beacon of cheerful hypocrisy; a place where rugby balls come stuffed full of coke, and the timeless pillars of Welsh life conceal a hotbed of joyriding, piss-drizzled karaoke and routine caninocide. Mogadishu, Somalia (Black Hawk Down) The Somalian capital city was admittedly no Viennese ballroom in the early 90s, when the UN peacekeeping mission went belly-up. But so one-sided was Ridley Scott’s account of one bad-tempered afternoon there, the entire urban infrastructure seems to exist solely to spew out a 28 Days Later-like stream of AK-toting fanatics who’ve been waiting all their lives to tear off a piece of a helicopter rotor. Another little-known Mogadishu fact unearthed by Scott: unusually for a city in the midst of the famously homogenous Horn of Africa gene pool, it is entirely populated by people from other parts of Africa. Paris (Irréversible) Hub of the Enlightenment, city of romance, home of button-cute Amélie Poulain – all rendered null and void as Gaspar Noé reduces the Paris street map to one sulphurous red underpass and forces us to watch nine minutes of rape and battery. Everyone would have settled for some unconvincing, Daft Punk-soundtracked mime instead. After that, it’s an impossibly long road back to heaven in his metaphysical journey through one night out in the capital. Romania (The Romanian new wave) This artistic vanguard swept the cobwebs of Transylvanian gothic cool away and, in a series of bleak but devastating noughties films, made the eastern European country known for something else: being a traumatised, towerblock-palisaded post-commie fiefdom in which if you weren’t literally dying (The Death of Mr Lazarescu), you could while away your allotted span on earth hunting down a backstreet abortion (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), denying your sexuality in a convent (Beyond the Hills), or suffering slow bureaucratic strangulation (Police, Adjective). Slovakia (Hostel) American xenophobia is a well-trodden story route, but Eli Roth really ran with it in the 2005 film that inaugurated the movie genre known as torture porn. Of course the whole of the European hospitality industry is some kind of sinister conspiratorial network designed to entrap gullible fratboy backpackers. Where else but darkest newly capitalistic eastern Europe, trafficking in every base human impulse, would host a sinister white-collar murder ring? Naturally one of the participants bears a striking resemblance to a famously unhinged Japanese director: pass me the cheesewire, eh, Miike? Bruges (In Bruges) “If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn’t, so it doesn’t.” Thanks to writer/director Martin McDonagh’s un-PC exuberance, Colin Farrell tramples all over chocolate-box Belgium; a heritage honeypot so boring that it appeals only to the unhinged inner child in Ralph Fiennes’ warbly-voiced psychopath mobster. “How can fucking swans not fucking be someone’s fucking thing?” How indeed. • Grimsby is released on 24 February.\n",
      "The Greasy Strangler review – tiresome shock tactics Where to start with this one? Like an early John Waters movie but without the sophistication, this aggressively inane horror comedy manages to cram in every disgusting, deviant activity you couldn’t begin to imagine. And yet, it’s still rather boring. All jarring discords, freakish genitals and a desperate need to shock, this is a singularly tiresome viewing experience. The plot, such as it is, focuses on the romantic rivalry between a father and son who both fall for the same woman on a disco walking tour of downtown LA. A film with literally no redeeming features.\n",
      "Maxwell returns: my working style is ‘Would Sade or Marvin do this?’ “I wish I was more presentable,” says Maxwell, packaged loosely in a denim jacket and jeans, in a top-floor room in a Manhattan hotel. “I’m post-Prince birthday cake.” The previous night, he was celebrating Prince’s birthday (the first since the pop star’s death in April), marking the life of someone whose work had been crucial to his own musical development. “A lot of what he did was why I felt: ‘Oh, I could be … maybe not like him, but I don’t have to be this cookie cutter …’” His voice trails off. I had seen Maxwell perform just a few days after Prince’s death, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage festival. He would pause between songs to talk about Prince’s influence on his work. “Everyone on this stage is here because of him,” he told the crowd. In the middle of his cover of Kate Bush’s This Woman’s Work – which he originally recorded in 2001 – he murmured the opening words from Let’s Go Crazy – “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life” – with a religious concentration. “It was such a tough show to get through,” he says now. Two weeks after our interview, Maxwell performs Nothing Compares 2 U at the BET awards; on the night, one of the verses mutates from the Prince original – “I went to the record store … Apple, Spotify, too, and they told me / ‘Boy you’d better try to make some music, which you can’t do / ’cause Prince is the truth!’” Prince was a fan of Maxwell, too. He had, apparently, been asking Harry Belafonte why Maxwell was taking so long to follow up 2009’s BLACKsummers’night album. “I’ve known [Prince] for a long time and was shocked that he actually genuinely cared about what I was doing, and why I was taking so long,” Maxwell says. Finally, that new album – blackSUMMERS’night – is out (there will, at some point, be a third album in the series, called blacksummers’NIGHT). But Maxwell does not work quickly. It is 20 years since his debut, Urban Hang Suite, which fitted into the burgeoning neo-soul movement of the time, alongside the crisp debuts of D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. Two more albums followed in relatively good time: Embrya in 1998, and Now in 2001. And then it was an eight-year wait – during which, he said, he took a break from the music industry to become a “full, 100% man” – until BLACKsummers’night, followed by another seven for the new album. “Why does it take so damn long? I would say … anxiety.” Two events paralysed him artistically: turning 40 in 2013, and the success of his previous record. BLACKsummers’night entered the US chart at No 1, while its single Pretty Wings topped the Hot R&B chart for 14 weeks. “I didn’t know [BLACKsummers’night] would be so loved. I had no idea. And now I have to put out something else, and it had better be better. And that can freeze you.” He requires the accumulation of experience in order to write, to have gone through something in order to translate it to record. He is also the only person motivating himself to work. “I don’t have a creative mafia that makes everything happen,” he says. “That’s not my style, I’m not interested in that. I wish I was – it’d be nice, I could have a really nice Lamborghini or something. The question begs: ‘Would Sade do this? Would Marvin do this?’” The reference to Sade is pertinent – he has two regular collaborators, Hod David and Stuart Matthewman, and the latter is one of Sade’s closest colleagues. He is allergic to the elevated atmosphere of celebrity. “Celebrities have competitors, and competition, and people they have to fight against or be better than,” he says. “Artists, it doesn’t really work that way.” On the cover of the new album, Maxwell obscures his face, as if to diminish his personality and focus attention on his music. “My friend asked me: ‘Why are you covering your face? It’s your album! You should be like: Look at me!’” he says. What’s more evident on the cover, in fact, is the space around Maxwell. “You know what they say. What’s hidden is always the most interesting thing,” he says. The new album feels less organic than its predecessor, which emphasised the nimble interactions of its musicians. BlackSUMMERS’night instead explores the tension between live performance and a more hermetic studio process. Maxwell talks about the song Gods, which builds on a four-bar melody, a glistening spine for the song: “I don’t know how these things come together,” he says. “I really cannot take credit for the writing or any of it. I am writing it, but it’s literally just … happening.” Like many of Maxwell’s songs, Gods concerns the physical as it flows into the metaphysical: “As you lied so convincingly / As you swore so religiously,” he sings, his voice evolving from its weathered and cracked register into a gentle shimmer: “You played the game of gods.” Two encounters dictated the song. “I was going through a really weird experience that involved this girl and this one particular individual that was upset about this girl who was interested in me,” he says. “It’s so funny – one thing will begin a song, and then another meeting will completely finish the song. So it’s like an arc of how everybody plays into this particular idea of the song.” And that is how Maxwell songs function: things arc into each other. “You want to say the right things. You want to say things you haven’t heard before, that people haven’t written before. How many times can you say: ‘I love you baby’?” Maxwell has made an album about a love that may never be understood or reciprocated. “It may happen, it may not,” he says. “Kind of a wait-and-see, Saturnial, pessimistic. I think it lives in both worlds because of how I think of things. There are no real guarantees. People are independent individuals.” He says he’s a classic romantic, and finds the modern mutations of dating – Tinder, OkCupid, and so on – alienating and uninhabitable. “It’s very disconnected and detached,” he says. “I’m not hating. I’m sure people have had amazing moments with their more controlled experience of the things they want to do. People are scared to be vulnerable and surrender themselves to someone else, and that’s really part of loving someone. I don’t know if what people are writing any more supports that.” At the centre of Maxwell’s music is his vulnerability. “I’m always looking for the spark of experience that then goes into the performance,” he says. “That’s what Kate Bush did to me. I didn’t really understand what the hell [This Woman’s Work] was about. I just knew that whatever she felt, whatever her feeling was that she had been through or gone through … I don’t care who you are when you hear that, it’s buckle-your-knees, fall-to-the-ground, it’s just beautiful. And it’s transcendental. It’s literally like stuff that you could expect to hear when walking into heaven after you die. That’s the thing that Prince had, too.” Now blackSUMMERS’night is done, the main feeling he has is relief. “I’m so happy it’s done,” he says. “I’m over this.” He says he has finished writing the third part of the trilogy and is in the process of recording it. And where will he be when it’s done? “I get to figure out where I want to go, where I want to live, what I want to build,” he says. “Family stuff. Finally, just get a life. I’ve been living life, but really getting a life finally, extending myself past my own self and the music that I’m so anxiety-ridden about having to do.” • blackSUMMERS’night is out now on Sony/RCA.\n",
      "Look into my eyes: Leave.EU campaign consulted TV hypnotist The leave campaign enlisted the TV hypnotist Paul McKenna to advise on some of its campaign broadcasts, it has emerged. The 53-year old author of bestselling self-help books including The Power to Influence, I Can Make You Happy and Hypnotic Gastric Band was asked by the Ukip-backed Leave.EU campaign to examine early edits of promotional videos. A source at the victorious campaign group told the that McKenna “understands the psychology of the mind” and helped Leave.EU “produce social media ads that resonated with people”. But he added: “We didn’t hypnotise anyone.” McKenna’s role emerged at the end of a week in which several senior politicians backtracked on persuasive campaign messages from the EU referendum on immigration controls and how much money saved from payments to the EU could be redirected to the NHS. The hypnotist is said to be a friend of Arron Banks, the Bristol-based multimillionaire insurance businessman who bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign with a £5.6m donation. McKenna became involved as Leave.EU spent millions of pounds building up its online following partly by using short, dramatic campaign videos posted on its social media accounts. It claimed that it had 1 million followers and supporters on social media by polling day on 23 June. “That was the key to winning wavering voters,” said Banks. “It was the massive connection through social media.” McKenna declined to comment in detail on what help he gave Leave.EU, but his spokesman said: “He is friendly with Arron Banks and Banks showed him a few rough cuts of promotional videos they were considering using in their campaign. [Paul] was quite intrigued by the new style of political campaigning, which he thought was influenced heavily by American politics.” McKenna has previously described modern hypnotism as “giving you greater communication capabilities with somebody”. He has said: “More important than power for me is the feeling of euphoria I get if I help somebody make a change, particularly if it is one that has dramatically impaired their life.” One of the videos McKenna is said to have assessed was a portentous 30-second broadcast on the Leave.EU Facebook page that attracted more than 1.6m views during the campaign. Over doom-laden music, it began by asking: “Are you concerned about the amount of crime being committed in the UK by foreign criminals?” and “Are you worried about the overcrowding of the UK and the burden on the NHS?” before switching to more upbeat music and asking: “Isn’t it time to take back control?” McKenna has also said that being absorbed and engrossed in TV broadcasts is equally as hypnotic as a hypnotically induced trance. This week Banks revealed that a central plank of the leave campaign’s successful strategy emerged from advice taken from the US election strategists Goddard Gunster that “facts don’t work”. He said: “The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the Trump success.” Several commentators have said the Republican candidate for the US presidency, Donald Trump, uses hypnotic techniques in his speeches. He uses repetition to make simple ideas stick. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader and Leave.EU supporter, did something similar during the EU referendum campaign, repeating again and again the mantra “take back control”.\n",
      "This week’s new live music The Maccabees, On tour There’s a case for the Maccabees being the English Kings Of Leon; not in sound, but in how the current, arena-filling proposition is almost completely unrecognisable from the quirky indie rock band they started out as. Having found huge success with progressively epic and seriously intentioned music, the band’s 2015 album Marks To Prove It debuted at No 1 in the charts. Interestingly, though, this landmark was achieved with a record that recovers some of the Maccabees’ original eccentricities. Of course, the windswept Arcade Fire-like characteristics remain, but some of the antic structure of their earlier records makes a welcome return. Barrowland, Fri; touring to 23 Jan JR Daughter, On tour Less is more with Daughter. A trio based around the talents of singer-songwriter Elena Tonra, the group have previously exercised a minimalism in all things, from the stripped-down nature of their arrangements to the manner in which they conceal their strong emotional content beneath a mainly placid delivery. But having shown promise as a kind of folky version of the xx, to judge from the singles from forthcoming second album Not To Disappear the mask is slipping. What seems to be emerging is a rather more melodramatic and rockier beast, wherein the band work less by implication, more by wearing their hearts on their sleeves. Cambridge Corn Exchange, Fri; touring to 28 Jan JR Angel Haze, On tour An MC with no absence of attitude, Angel Haze has found it difficult to walk quite as hard as she has historically talked. All round, this combative confidence has brought her as much bad as it has good. Professionally, her Classick mixtape of three years ago found her confronting the horrible circumstances of her early life on top of some of hip-hop’s legendary beats. About the same time, she entered into a social media war with Azealia Banks, a rather distracting and unproductive move that served to invite unhelpful comparisons between the pair. As it turned out, Haze’s raw delivery and aggressive stance was an unsuccessful fit with the mainstream, but now she is back among the independents, where her underdog determination may find a more favourable environment in which to develop.

There have been hints about what we can expect from the upcoming Rattle era, and some of the performers with whom he will work. It’s already clear, for instance, that the great pianist Krystian Zimerman is likely to be a regular visitor, while another of Rattle’s collaborators, the director Peter Sellars, is involved in the semi-staging of Pelléas Et Mélisande that Rattle is conducting this weekend. Rattle and Sellars have worked on Debussy’s opera together before, for an impressive full performance in Amsterdam in the 1990s, but this will be a production designed for the concert hall, similar to that the pair have already undertaken with Bach’s Passions.

      "A matter of some gravity: how to have an argument on the internet Poor Douglas Carswell. On Twitter last week he confused the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon and got crushed by the far stronger forces of social media. It all happened so quickly. To illustrate the point that Britain trades more with its near neighbours in Europe than larger but more distant economies such as the US or China, Paul Nightingale, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, tweeted a gravitational analogy that drew a brisk response from Carswell: Nightingale respectfully pointed out the error but the hapless Ukip MP was immediately deluged in a yellow tide of piss-taking. An #AskCarswell hashtag soon popped up to poke further fun at the member for Clacton and the story was gleefully picked up by the press. The derision was deserved – at least to some extent. In the eyes of many Carswell already has a difficult relationship with facts, revealed by his loud insistence during the referendum campaign that the UK would be better off to the tune of £350m a week if it left the EU, a claim repeatedly debunked by the head of the UK Statistics Authority. He had also been patronising in responding to the Sussex professor, expressing surprise that the “head of Science research at a university refutes idea sun’s gravity causes tides”. Yet it’s also true that Carswell was less wrong than many people realised. One tweeter pointed out that the sun’s gravitational influence on the tides is actually about 40% that of the moon’s, which was news to me — and I have a degree in physics. Judging from his timeline, Carswell has so far admitted no scientific error. Instead he tried to move the conversation back to trade and Brexit (though even here, the weight of evidence appears to be on Nightingale’s side). I suspect he was mildly embarrassed by the faux pas but felt little desire to acknowledge as much before the sneering chorus on Twitter. Why expose yourself to further mockery? But I’m speculating here – I’ve never met Carswell so don’t really know what makes him tick. Today, the incident is largely forgotten. Just another twitterstorm in a teacup. But the trouble is that this is how it goes day after day on social media. Thanks to the internet, communication far beyond our real life social circles has never been easier but it’s hard to escape the impression that the quality of our public discourse has never been poorer. Carswell’s gravitational spat may pale beside the pervasive currents of misogyny, racism, homophobia, antisemitism and islamophobia that wash daily across the online world, but the descent into mockery and vitriol is all too rapid, whatever the topic. When was the last time you saw an enlightening exchange between a Corbynista and a Blairite? What is it about life online that unleashes our inner demons? We seem to have made a leap in technology for which evolution, in its blind stumbling, has not prepared us. Most likely it is another distancing effect, this time due to computerisation. We might now be able to connect with half the world but we do so from behind a keyboard. The faces – and the humanity – of the people that we interact with are easily lost in the rapid fire of typed exchanges. It is little wonder that some newspapers are closing down their comment threads. Though this may partly be for economic reasons, it is surely also an acknowledgement that they add little to public debate. I’ve succumbed myself from time to time – and in these pages. I have on occasion taken exception to what I felt to be largely ill-founded critiques of science and scientists by the columnist Simon Jenkins, and responded with outrage, with mockery and with facts. But after the latest exchange, I paused to re-consider. It might have been cathartic to vent my frustration and then to be cheered from the sidelines by friends and followers (almost all of them of a scientific stripe), but to what real end? We just seemed to be talking past one another. So I tried a different tack. I bought a copy of one of my favourite popular science books (Matthew Cobb’s Life’s Greatest Secret) and sent it to the columnist with a conciliatory note, to follow up on the offer of buying him a drink that I had appended to my latest broadside. And blow me if he didn’t email back to accept the invitation. A couple of weeks ago we met in a quiet bar around the corner from where I work and over a couple of pints of a rather tasty Kent lager talked about science, universities, Brexit, grammar schools, Northern Ireland, and the travails of online discourse. I won’t go into specifics since it was a private encounter but, while we still might not agree on everything, face-to-face there was plenty of cordiality and common ground. I know what you’re thinking: “Two people who write for the had a drink and found that they agreed on some stuff? Big deal!” Well, yes, I’m skating on platitudinous ice and this is hardly an original point, but the meeting was to me an important reminder of how the human factor, so vivid in real life, is so readily forgotten online. It’s complicated. Although anonymity is often blamed for online rudeness, it can also foster participation and risk-taking, opening up new opportunities for discussion. But how do we find the right balance between open, constructive argument and ending up in an echo-chamber? This question is at the core of the ’s laudable The Web We Want campaign. There are no easy answers – though some experiments in nudging community self-regulation online are showing promise. Even scientists need to be mindful of becoming trapped in tribal enclaves, whatever the provocation. On Twitter I try to use the mute button sparingly – only when the rancour gets too much. Each time I do feels like a defeat but I just don’t have the time or the heart to engage with every dispute. And although it’s not possible to have a drink with everyone you end up arguing with on the internet, I have resolved to try to imagine doing so. That strategy will make little headway with the out-and-out trolls or the shitposters, but there are still plenty of people of good faith out there that I disagree with profoundly. Carswell may well be one of them. Should we happen to rub up against one another online, hopefully at least one of us can take away something positive from the encounter.

      "Natalie Cole, singer and daughter of Nat King Cole, dies aged 65 Natalie Cole, the award-winning singer and daughter of jazz legend Nat King Cole, has died. Cole, whose hits included This Will Be and Unforgettable, died aged 65 on Thursday night, according to her publicist Maureen O’Connor. Her family said she died at Cedars-Sinai medical centre in Los Angeles due to complications from ongoing health issues. “Natalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived … with dignity, strength and honour. Our beloved mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain unforgettable in our hearts forever,” read the statement from her son, Robert Yancy, and sisters Timolin and Casey Cole. The singer had battled drug problems and hepatitis for many years. She had a kidney transplant in May 2009. Fellow performers paid tribute on Friday night following the news of her death. Aretha Franklin said: “I am sorry to hear about Natalie Cole’s passing. I had to hold back the tears. I know how hard she fought. She fought for so long. She was one of the greatest singers of our time.” Tony Bennett described her as “an exceptional jazz singer”. He said: “It was an honour to have recorded and performed with her on several occasions. She was a lovely and generous person who will be greatly missed.” Dionne Warwick said she was “more like family than friend … My heart aches. My sincere condolences to her family and may she now rest in peace.” The Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted: “#NatalieCole, sister beloved & of substance and sound. May her soul rest in peace. #Inseperable.” The comedian Arsenio Hall said he named his bass guitar after her when he was in college. “As a young stand up comic I opened for Natalie Cole. She was all that, in all ways! (RIP ).” Cole’s greatest success came with her 1991 album, Unforgettable … With Love, which paid tribute to her father with reworked versions of some of his best known-songs, including That Sunday That Summer, Too Young and Mona Lisa. Her voice was spliced with her father’s in the title track, offering a delicate duet more than 25 years after his death. The album sold about 14m copies and won six Grammys, including album of the year, and record and song of the year for the title track. While making the album, Cole said she had to “throw out every R&B lick that I had ever learned and every pop trick I had ever learned. With him, the music was in the background and the voice was in the front.” Cole was also nominated for an Emmy award in 1992 for a televised performance of her father’s songs. “That was really my thank you,” she said in 2006. “I owed that to him.” Another father-daughter duet, When I Fall in Love, won a Grammy in 1996 for best pop collaboration with vocals, and a follow-up album, Still Unforgettable, won best traditional pop vocal album of 2008. Born in Los Angeles to Nat King Cole, who was already a well-known singer, and former Duke Ellington Orchestra singer Maria Hawkins Ellington, Cole was exposed to some of the greats of US soul music. By the age of six, she sang on her father’s Christmas album and by 11 was performing in her own right. In 2008, she said: “I still love recording and still love the stage, but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.” In her 2000 autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, Cole discussed how she had battled heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol addiction for many years. She spent six months in rehab in 1983. When she announced in 2008 that she had been diagnosed with hepatitis C, a liver disease spread through contact with infected blood, she blamed her past intravenous drug use. Cole received chemotherapy to treat the hepatitis and “within four months, I had kidney failure”, she told CNN’s Larry King in 2009. She needed dialysis three times a week until she received a donor kidney on 18 May 2009. Cole toured through much of her illness, often receiving dialysis at hospitals around the world. “I think that I am a walking testimony [that] you can have scars,” she told People magazine. “You can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.”\n",
      "The Man Who Fell to Earth review – a freaky concept album of a film Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth is rereleased after 40 years and it looks more exotic, more preposterous, more fascinating than ever, like a hyper-evolved midnight movie in the manner of Roger Corman. Roeg shows us some of his classic narrative dislocations and juxtapositions; this has something of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, but Roeg is genuinely uninhibited about sex in a way that Kubrick never was. And of course there is an extraordinary sui generis central performance by David Bowie as the intergalactic visitor Thomas Newton – his unselfconscious gentleness and vulnerability now look very moving and bizarrely authentic in a way that they didn’t in 1976. Is the movie a metaphor for immigration and innovation and a sclerotic corporate culture? Or is it perhaps a pop culture parable for the British music invasion? (I like to think that Newton’s astronaut-ambitions inspired our own Richard Branson.) Or is it simply about Bowie himself? The story unfolds in a daring sequence of narrative leaps. Newton crash-lands in a small town where he is befriended by a hotel receptionist Mary Lou (Candy Clark) in whose presence this delicate stripling faints; she has to carry him to his room – an extraordinary sequence. They become an item. Newton quickly finds himself in New York, where his superior intelligence and knowledge allow him to create a world-beating energy and media company, which hires a disillusioned, lecherous chemistry professor Nathan Bryce (Rip Torn), the only person in whom the increasingly reclusive Newton can confide. Newton needs to establish utter mastery of Earth’s technology so that he use its water for his own drought-stricken planet. But, far from being a sinister predator, Newton is a delicate victim, a Wildean holy child of poignant unworldliness, whose business is taken from him. He stays young while everyone else gets old. A freaky, compelling concept album of a film.\n",
      "Sa Dingding: The Butterfly Dream review – Chinese folk-electronica fusion for global pop market This should have been an intriguing set. Sa Dingding is one of China’s most successful and unusual artists, a powerful singer who has specialised in reviving Chinese and Mongolian folk themes while mixing traditional instruments with electronica. And the producer of her new album is Karsh Kale, the New York-based tabla player who has worked with Anoushka Shankar. But this is not the China-India sound-clash that it could have been, even though Dingding plays the guzheng zither and morin khuur fiddle, and the Indian musicians include flautist Naveen Kumar and sitar player Azeem Ahmed Alvi. There are some strong songs here, but they are weakened by the overuse of electronica. The yelping Ding Ding Sa or clattering Yin and Yang are aimed at the global pop market, though the cool, sitar-backed Oriental Beauty and rousing finale, Good Luck Song, are reminders of Dingding’s versatile, often acrobatic vocals.\n",
      "Disco's Saturday Night Fiction Picture it: a writer pens a magazine article and it’s an instant sensation. Producers come calling, he sells the rights for tens of thousands, the tabloids give him a nickname, acquaintances greet him as a friend, cheques flood in, he attends the premiere of his film in Los Angeles with a famous disco singer on his arm. It’s glitzy, it’s glam, it’s Hollywood, baby. But as he makes his way through the frenzy outside the theatre, through security, paparazzi and screaming teenage girls, he is filled with moral panic. Why? Saturday Night Fever was released in 1977, and has since grossed $285m worldwide. The soundtrack became one of the bestselling film album of all time after staying at No 1 for 24 consecutive weeks, reinvigorating the Bee Gees’ career, and its star, John Travolta, became one of the youngest actors to be nominated for the best actor Oscar. Decades on, not many remember that the phenomenon was down to one man: Northern Irish rock critic Nik Cohn and his report of 7 June, 1976 for New York magazine, Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Nights, which was published 40 years ago this month. Cohn was the author of a number of books including the 1969 rock history Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom. A protege of swinging London, he partied with rock stars, joined the Who on tour, and is said by some to have been instrumental in the genesis of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust. He had his portrait shot by Iain Macmillan – the photographer behind the Beatles’ Abbey Road cover – and from the age of 18 was contributing briefings about mods and rockers to the . After crossing the Atlantic and signing on with New York magazine in 1975, the writer, who came to feel disenchanted with the establishment music business, persuaded the mag’s founder and editor Clay Felker to let him document disco – a new, largely ethnic, largely gay underground trend that had taken over parts of New York City. The result was the profile of an “ultimate Face”. Vincent, a young Italian-American worked in a hardware store during the week and partied at a disco club called 2001 Odyssey on the weekend. Vincent “was the very best dancer in Bay Ridge … he owned 14 floral shirts, five suits, eight pairs of shoes, three overcoats, and had appeared on American Bandstand”. He and his friends knew nothing of flower power, Bob Dylan or Ken Kesey. They were opulent but poor, proud but shy. “The new generation takes few risks,” Cohn wrote. “It goes through high school, obedient; graduates, looks for a job, saves and plans. Endures. And once a week, on Saturday night, its one great moment of release, it explodes.” The intro declared: “Everything described in this article is factual and was either witnessed by me or told to me directly by the people involved. Only the names of the main characters have been changed.” The rest is cinema history: film rights were sold to producer Robert Stigwood, who had just signed a three-picture deal with a young TV actor called John Travolta. Screenwriter Norman Wexler transformed Vincent into Tony Manero. So unprecedented was the fanfare that when Stigwood’s 23-year-old assistant Kevin McCormick traipsed through Los Angeles looking for a director, one agent, according to Vanity Fair, told him, “Kid, my directors do movies. They don’t do magazine articles.” Director John Badham had no such qualms, and in December 1977 his movie took $11m in its first 11 days and Travolta became an overnight sensation. Twenty years later came a bombshell. In December 1997 New York magazine published an article in which Cohn confessed that there never was a Vincent. There was no “Lisa”, “Billy”, “John James”, “Lorraine” or “Donna” either. While 2001 Odyssey existed, it wasn’t the way the writer described it in 1976. The whole scene of disco-loving Italians, as mythologised in Saturday Night Fever, was exaggerated. The most bizarre detail was that his disco protagonists were in fact based on mods Cohn had known in London. The writer was “painfully aware” that everything Fever had brought him – the fame, the fortune – was the result of a lie. The real story went like this: in 1976 Cohn met a disco dancer named Tu Sweet, who introduced him to the clubs of New York, including one in Bay Ridge called 2001 Odyssey. One night the two trawled through the underbelly of New York – a land of auto shops, transmission specialists and alignment centres – to find the place. A drunken brawl was in progress and as Cohn opened the cab door one of the guys reeled over the gutter and threw up over his trouser leg. So he just upped and returned to the safe comforts of Manhattan. One image stayed with the writer, though, that of a figure in flared crimson pants and a black body shirt standing in the doorway of the club and calmly watching the action. There was a style about him, Cohn said, a sense of his own specialness that reminded the writer of a teen gang in his hometown of Derry and a mod named Chris he’d met in London in 1965. When Cohn went back to Odyssey he didn’t see the young man in the doorway again. “Plus, I made a lousy interviewer,” he wrote. “I knew nothing about this world, and it showed. Quite literally, I didn’t speak the language. So I faked it. I conjured up the story of the figure in the doorway, and named him Vincent. Taking all I knew about the snake-charmer in Derry and, more especially, about Chris the mod in London, I translated them as best I could to Brooklyn. Then I went back to Bay Ridge in daylight and noted the major landmarks. I walked some streets, went into a couple of stores. Studied the clothes, the gestures, the walks. Imagined how it would feel to burn up, all caged energies, with no outlet but the dancefloor and the rituals of Saturday night. Finally, I wrote it all up. And presented it as fact.” So how did he get away with one of the most daring acts of journalistic forgery? While Tribal Rites reads like a novelisation, it must be understood in the context of the time it was written: the tail-end of the era of New Journalism, where writers used literary techniques and a subjective perspective to present fact as fiction. It followed similar works by the likes of Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Hunter S Thompson and Norman Mailer. When I first approached Cohn for this article, he said he no longer wanted to discuss the topic. But after several back-and-forth emails, he did say that he doubted any magazine would publish the Tribal Rites piece today. “It reads to me as obvious fiction, albeit based on observation and some knowledge of disco culture. No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry. Many magazine writers used fictional techniques to tell supposedly factual stories. No end of liberties were taken. Few editors asked tough questions. For the most part it was a case of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’. “Magazine writing then was basically a boys’ club. There was a lot of wretched excess. Along with some great writing came reams of self-indulgent bollocks. Tribal Rites being fiction was never a great secret. I remember once, at the end of a long night, blurting out to a publisher that the story was made up. ‘You don’t say,’ the publisher drawled. ‘And Liberace is gay.’” For context, Gay Talese, now a bestselling author and one of the pioneers of new journalism and author of ‘Frank Sinatra Has a Cold’, explains that his intention as a young journalist was to write short stories using real characters. “I have always been inspired by great short story writers, the first being the French writer Guy de Maupassant,” he said. “Later I also began reading short stories by famous novelists – F Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and more contemporary writers such as John O’Hara, Irwin Shaw, Carson McCullers, John Cheever and others. My newspaper articles were all written as if short stories: there was scene-setting, dialogue, much description of people and places.” But while the articles were presented as stories, they were never fictionalised. “Nothing was invented, all the names of the characters were real, and verifiably truthful.” Caroline Miller, who edited New York magazine at the time of Cohn’s confession, said her predecessor, Felker, wouldn’t have published Tribal Rites if he thought it fabricated. “That said, remember that 70s Brooklyn was a foreign country to most New York magazine editors,” she told me. “It wasn’t cool, and some of them had probably never been there – even to Brooklyn Heights, which was Norman Mailer territory. So they may not have had good radar for credibility. Also, after the zeitgeisty opening about the blue-collar disco tribe, [Tribal Rites] is all narrative, and that much narrative detail tends to read as real. Conversation in cars. What Vincent was thinking as he looked in the mirror…” Miller and her team published Cohn’s admission because it was newsworthy. “Here’s a guy basically bragging about fabricating a legendary story and getting away with it,” she said. “And it certainly added to our understanding of pop culture myth-making – the idea that a mashup of people and scenes Nik had collected on both side of the Atlantic could go essentially unchallenged, and have such staying power.” Cohn has said that were it not for Jim McMullan’s accompanying illustrations the piece might never have seen daylight. McMullan based these on the photographs he took in 2001 Odyssey but, fundamentally, he never met Cohn’s protagonist. “I went to the club twice and moved around, taking my photos without interacting much with any of the patrons,” McMullan recalled. “Nik took a different path through the crowds so we didn’t exchange notes. “I finished my paintings several weeks before Nik finished his story so I wasn’t really reacting to how he saw the scene at the club. It did seem like an amazingly dramatic story arc and the kind of ‘working-class’ story he was already famous for.” It so happened that the design director of New York magazine, Milton Glaser, was amazed by the reportage style of the paintings. “Clay also came to see the work that way... I suspect that because the art was all ready to go before Nik finished writing, it put some pressure on him to get it written. Had the paintings not already impressed Milton and Clay, I suppose it might have been easier to scuttle the whole project.” Did McMullan’s art indicate a truth to the piece? While Cohn’s descriptions of the club’s “Faces” were based on the working class in England, they weren’t entirely off the mark. “Just like the Italian-Americans, the mods shopped for that perfect shirt,” Colleen “Cosmo” Murphy, an American radio broadcaster, DJ, producer and founder of Classic Album Sundays, explained to me over coffee in London one morning. “It was about looking like they were better off than they really were, sticking their money into things like music and clothes. They bought records, certain types of trousers, certain types of jackets. It was an attitude. “It’s that culture of people who have their regular job during the week and live to go out on the weekend. A blue-collar worker in Brooklyn isn’t going to be defined by their job. Who they really are is who they are when they go out. Just like a mod. A mod might be bricklayer, but they’re a mod.” Bill Brewster, former editor of Mixmag USA and founder of Djhistory.com, echoed this: “It’s a universal story that had been going on for decades even before there were DJs playing records,” he said. “Working-class kids going out on a Friday and Saturday and getting off their heads to American black music. It was happening in the cellars of Paris during the occupation in terms of jazz records. Those archetypes, even though Cohn based them on people in London, were obviously happening in New York as well. I think it was an educated guess on his part, and a correct one.” Disco as a genre and culture had already been gathering pace in New York so Saturday Night Fever was just the tipping point of something that had been going on for a while. “Even before disco was officially called disco, you had David Mancuso’s loft parties, in the late 60s, in downtown Manhattan, where he played danceable acid-rock, R&B, mixing it all up,” said Murphy, who has collaborated with Mancuso in the past. “They were all about integrating different kinds of people, whether it was class, race, sexual orientation. People like David Morales and Larry Levan were going as kids. At the same time Francis Grasso became the first DJ to start mixing records together with two turntables. In the mid-70s these other clubs started rising – Studio 54, which was the glitzy manhattan club, where Andy Warhol, Grace Jones and Liza Minelli hung out, and places like 2001 Odyssey, which were for the working-class Brooklynites.” But in the end it was Cohn’s article and Saturday Night Fever that gave the decade its cultural identity. “As a child I was living in Massachusetts, in a white suburban New England small town, listening to rock and pop ,” Murphy said. “Then this article happened, the movie came out and disco blew up across white America overnight. Me and my friends would dance to the soundtrack at slumber parties. I had aunts and uncles who were taking disco-dancing lessons.” Then came the backlash. DJ Steve Dahl headed up a Disco Demolition Night in Chicago in July 1979. People wore “disco sucks” T-shirts. The Bee Gees became cheesy, Chic became cheesy, and by the 80s disco was a dirty word. “Saturday Night Fever was probably the thing that killed off disco in the end,” Murphy said. Cohn, now 70, lives in Ghent, New York. His life reads like a blockbuster of its own – after Tribal Rites he continued writing, true stories mostly, and in 1983 was arrested for conspiring to import millions of dollars worth of heroin and cocaine into the US. The more serious charges were dropped and Cohn was given five years’ probation for possession. His life, the writer then realised, had been unravelling and it was time for a change. “Why did I decide to come clean in 1997? It simply felt like time,” he told me. “What seemed OK to me when I was young and stoned no longer sat right. Accountability, let’s say.” Cohn has always maintained that what was genuine was the staying power of Saturday Night Fever itself. That central figure, with all his grace, energy and passion. A nobody who once a week was a somebody. “Tribal Rites is about identity,” he said. “Finding a place in the world where you can shine. What still resonates, to me at least, is the sense of yearning. If I was writing the story today, Vincent might be trans…”\n",
      "Wilderness – the festival that mixes music and Momentum Naked cricket. A Chicago house legend. The uplifting sound of a 30-piece orchestra. Wilderness certainly has a varied palate, yet caters to a rather one-note clientele. Now in its sixth year and hosted on the 5,000-acre Cornbury Park estate in the heart of Oxfordshire, the festival is the kind of place David Cameron might leave his kid behind at. Or, to put it another way: I spent Saturday at a Raymond Blanc lunch sat between an accountant and a former Whitehall staffer. One half of the Brexit divide writ Magnum-size. With a weaker lineup than in previous years, Wilderness still delivers some strong musical moments on what is a gloriously sunny weekend. Robert Plant, the Corbyn-aged (67) former Led Zeppelin frontman, electrifies the Friday night headline slot with Whole Lotta Love during his only UK 2016 gig. Lianne La Havas, returning after her memorable 2012 appearance here, exudes genuine joy on the main stage, switching deftly between numerous Gibson Les Pauls and telling us her mum just called to say her music’s being used on the BBC Olympics coverage. A cover of Aretha Franklin’s Say a Little Prayer is a treat, and the singer’s dress is so much admired that someone in the front row has the good sense to ask where it’s from (Temperley). Elsewhere, stumbling upon Diana Yukawa’s haunting violin while scoffing an £8 falafel scotch egg is a revelation as the sun sets on the Atrium stage. James Rhodes proves, via Rachmaninov, why he has 50,000 Twitter followers. And local boys Glass Animals impress with their intelligent fusion of R&B, zig-zag bass-lines and Tetris beats. Shura’s set is assured and Touch gets the twentysomethings up from east London throwing angular shapes. Over in the Valley, a deep cleavage of greenery and ancient trees, Derrick Carter’s perfectly judged 2am house is elegantly lit by Tracey Emin-inspired neons. But Sunday headliners the Flaming Lips disappoint with a weak vocal and the bizarre choice to have frontman Wayne Coyne barely visible behind a curtain of lights Away from the music, there is spoon carving, wild swimming and a cabaret show featuring a PVC-clad Kitty Bang Bang. Oh, and a man riding a bicycle along a tightrope through flames, because why the hell not? The star of one of numerous insightful debates is Larry Sanders, forever to be introduced as brother of Bernie, but delivering salient points as Green Party health spokesperson in his own right. In the same debate, George Galloway “will not apologise” for being a straight white man and rails against “rightwing Ed Miliband”. He’s dressed all in black despite the 26 degree heat and is wearing a fedora indoors. Momentum’s James Schneider speaks of a burgeoning Labour membership and there’s a ripple of applause like a second round Wimbledon win on court 2 from an audience who have just paid £20 for glitter accessories. Wilderness’s general vibe appears to be a mashup of Latitude and Hay, with the dress-up chops of Secret Garden. And Sunday night’s Bowie tribute – featuring the Wilderness orchestra and choir; London Contemporary Voices; Kate Nash and Charlotte Church – is a properly stirring experience. Ending with Memory of a Free Festival might be somewhat awkward for obvious reasons, but it does allow for a rousing finale singalong. The audience filters away to a Bowie voiceover: “see you all once again, another day, in another place”.

      "Tottenham win title for youthful promise and being the most watchable If you’ve somehow managed to miss the opening eight months of the Premier League season you could have picked up a pretty decent precis of the action so far just by watching Sunday’s games at the Stadium of Light and White Hart Lane. Basically it’s been like that all along. Leicester City have scored lots of breakaway goals and played like a proper team. It’s been emotional. People have cried. The usual heavyweights have ranged from poor to bafflingly dreadful. And beyond that Tottenham Hotspur have been the most watchable, most promising, most intriguing team in the league this season. All issues of sentiment, underdoggery and fairytale glee aside, it is an achievement that deserves at least a slice of the adulation being lavished on the champions-elect. This is not to suggest Leicester are unworthy league winners. The table is never wrong. Leicester have been the most consistent team by some way, seven points clear and not so much sprinting for the line as already off on one of those helmet-doffing, high-fiving home-run trundles around the baseball diamond, waving to the crowd, taking the cheers, ball safely spiralling off above the bleachers into the blue. Even in the second half of the season Leicester have dropped fewer points than their nearest challengers. They beat Spurs 1-0 at White Hart Lane in January, and deservedly so. For Claudio Ranieri’s team this has been both a wonderful story and a purely sporting triumph of teamwork, talent and unblinking focus. Still, one achievement should not diminish another and Spurs have been by so many other measures the most compelling team in the Premier League, the most layered, all the while remaining the only Premier League team (fairytale Foxes included) to run a profit on transfer spending over the past five years. Against Manchester United on Sunday they started poorly. Dele Alli made a lovely run for his goal but otherwise he was largely absent. Harry Kane ragged Chris Smalling about once or twice but touched the ball only 33 times, a rare lack of involvement for an unusually assertive No9. The full-backs were muted, Kyle Walker bothered at times by the high-class menace of Anthony Martial. And yet even on an off-day Tottenham were hugely enthralling in the periods when the pistons began to fire. By the time the goal rush arrived in the final 20 minutes Mauricio Pochettino’s team had begun to swarm in that familiar way, every passing angle, every pocket of space choked off. This isn’t so much the old push-and-run Spurs as push-and-run-and-snipe-and-hustle, albeit in a controlled kind of way. The idea Tottenham will inevitably tire themselves out before the season’s end has always been based on a slight misunderstanding. This isn’t simply covering every blade of grass, Carlton Palmer-style. There is no blur of perpetual motion here. Spurs’ defensive movements are instead minutely drilled, with every shift of position among the opposition a cue for some interlocking reshuffle of the pieces, energy not so much wasted as put to synchronised good use. Often Eric Dier and Mousa Dembélé will stand still, waiting for the play to arrange itself around them. There are some interesting similarities between the league’s top two. Both have a simple set of methods based around teamwork and quick, accurate passing. Both are genuine collectives, the role of each player equally weighted, without favourites or luxuries or glitzy passengers. But Spurs simply have more depth to their game. They are a team who can score all kinds of goals, can play with the ball or on the break, for whom eight players have scored three or more goals in the league this season. Spurs have scored more goals than anyone else while conceding fewer. Their starting outfield players were, on average, almost four years younger than Leicester’s equivalent on Sunday. Ranieri’s men will be hugely impressive champions but there is another gear to come in this Tottenham team. Or at least, there should be. If there is reason to celebrate Spurs excellence, even as the season dwindles into a race for second place, it is the simple fact that such progress is precarious. Last weekend Sir Alex Ferguson gave an interview to Sky Sports, apparently at his own behest, in which he lavished praise on Pochettino’s work. It is hard to see any obvious reason, beyond the really obvious, why Ferguson would choose to do this. Pochettino is an ambitious manager. He will be hugely in demand now, as will Tottenham’s best players. There is a shelf life to any rising team these days. Money will not allow this to go on unchecked for ever. Not that there is reason to think anyone’s leaving just yet. This Spurs team can look forward to another title challenge next season, with plenty of flux among the usual heavyweights and the new champions facing a different set of challenges, not least the demands of running a midweek team as well. Spurs dropped seven points this season after Europa League fixtures, the exact extent of Leicester’s lead at the top. By the end against United, Tottenham were lolling about at White Hart Lane like drunken lords, no doubt thrilled by the sense of their own power in that three-goal burst but still aware that for this season the race may be done. For the most captivating of second-placers the challenge now is simply to make their excellence count in more tangible ways.\n",
      "Bruce Springsteen announces four UK stadium shows for the summer Bruce Springsteen has announced four UK stadium shows for this summer. He brings the E Street Band to Britain for The River tour, in which he plays the entirety of his 1980 double album, finishing his set with a selection of highlights from the rest of his career. Springsteen will play the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on 25 May, Hampden Park in Glasgow on 2 June, Ricoh Arena in Coventry on 3 June, and Wembley Stadium in London on 5 June. Tickets go on sale on 25 February at 9am. The US leg of the tour has been received ecstatically. “The greatest revelation of the revisiting of this album is that, at its core, The River sees the band do something rare: get quiet,” wrote Mark Guarino, reviewing the Chicago show for the . “With the songs played in order, the album begins slowly to stretch out and soon, the slower songs begin to edge out the quick and fast. These songs – Point Blank, Fade Away, Stolen Car – grow into cinematic set pieces and since they are not often featured on the band’s setlist, there is a sense the band was energized, skillfully filtering all their strengths for big gestures into smaller pockets.”\n",
      "Rod Temperton obituary Those who pore over the writing credits on album sleeves know the name of the songwriter Rod Temperton, who has died of cancer aged 66. But despite his huge hits for Michael Jackson, above all the title track for Thriller, he was so low-profile that he was nicknamed the “invisible man”. His compositional skills led to him writing three songs for Jackson’s 1979 album Off the Wall, which went on to sell more than 20m copies. In 1982, he wrote three of the nine songs on Jackson’s Thriller, including the title track, and his contributions helped the album to shift 65m copies and become the biggest seller of all time. Temperton, who had previously been a member of the funk-disco band Heatwave, was recruited to the Jackson team by producer Quincy Jones in 1978, as Jones was preparing to record Off the Wall. Temperton formed a fruitful partnership with Jones and the recording engineer Bruce Swedien, prompting the three of them to be dubbed the A-Team. “I’d never heard Heatwave until Quincy told me about them,” Swedien recalled. “Rod was like Beethoven – when he would bring a demo in the studio, every detail was complete.” Of the songs Temperton wrote for Off the Wall, the title track reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard pop chart, while Rock With You topped it. Both were Top 10 hits in Britain. His third track, Burn This Disco Out, was released as the B-side of Beat It. When Thriller was recorded three years later, Temperton was seen as indispensable by Jones. “Quincy said, ‘Well, you came up with the title of the last album, see what you can do for this album’,” Temperton recalled in a 2006 interview for Radio 2, describing how he wrote Thriller. “I went back to the hotel. I wrote two or three hundred titles for this song.” He toyed with the idea of calling it Midnight, before he hit upon Thriller. “Something in my head just said ‘this is the title’. You could visualise it on top of the Billboard charts ... So I knew I had to write it as Thriller, and I wrote all the words very quickly, then went to the studio and we did it.” It was also Temperton’s idea to include the macabre spoken word section at the end of the song: “One thing I’d thought about was to have somebody, a famous voice in the horror genre, to do this vocal.” As luck would have it Jones’s wife was friendly with the actor Vincent Price. He was delighted to be offered the job. Temperton wrote out the text in a cab on his way to the recording session, Price (who took a flat fee) did only two takes, and the result entered into music industry folklore. The album also featured the Temperton songs Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life; only Jackson himself contributed more numbers. The songwriter’s journey to the centre of the West Coast entertainment business began in the Lincolnshire seaside resort of Cleethorpes, where he was born. He would later describe how his father put a transistor radio on his pillow when he was a child and he would fall asleep listening to the pop station Radio Luxembourg. He attended De Aston school in Market Rasen, where he formed a band in which he was the drummer. On leaving school he worked for a time at the Ross Foods frozen fish factory in Grimsby. Meanwhile he persevered as a musician. Switching from drums to keyboards, he played in several dance bands and in the early 1970s moved to Germany. With guitarist Bernd Springer he formed a band called Sundown Carousel, which played soul music covers in bars and GI clubs across Germany. In 1974, having also been part of a group called The Hammer, he replied to an advert in the Melody Maker that had been placed by Johnnie Wilder Jr. He had sung with a number of groups while serving with the US army in West Germany and was putting together a new outfit. The band began performing in London as Chicago’s Heatwave before shortening their name to Heatwave, adding a funk beat to their disco sound and signing to GTO Records in 1976. They recorded a debut album, Too Hot to Handle, and in 1977 their third single from it, Boogie Nights (written by Temperton, as were all the songs on the album), reached No 2 on both the UK chart and the Billboard Hot 100. “I’ve always tried to write my music with an American flavour and really Boogie Nights is the most universal song I’ve written,” he said at the time. The follow-up single, the ballad Always and Forever, reached the UK Top 10 and climbed to 18 on the Billboard pop chart. Luther Vandross recorded a version of it for his album Songs (1994). A second album, Central Heating, appeared in 1978, and another Temperton composition, The Groove Line, delivered another US Top 10 hit. It was in 1978 that Temperton decided to leave the group to concentrate on songwriting, though he would continue to contribute material to Heatwave. He soon received his priceless opportunity with Jackson and became a writer for countless major artists. Among his credits are George Benson’s most successful single, Give Me the Night (1980), from the album of the same name, various contributions to Jones’s The Dude (1981), and several co-writing credits on Donna Summer’s album Donna Summer; Baby, Come To Me for Patti Austin and James Ingram; and tracks on Herbie Hancock’s Lite Me Up (all 1982). He also wrote for Manhattan Transfer, Siedah Garrett, Aretha Franklin, Jeffrey Osborne, Karen Carpenter, Mica Paris and many more. In 1986 he was nominated for the Oscar for best original song for the track Miss Celie’s Blues, which he had co-written with Lionel Richie and Jones for the film The Color Purple. Temperton also wrote five songs for the Billy Crystal movie Running Scared (1986). He remained self-effacing, though his success funded homes in Los Angeles, the south of France, Fiji, Switzerland and Britain. Tongue in cheek he summed up: “I watch telly, catch up on the news, and maybe the phone will ring.” He is survived by his wife, Kathy. • Rodney Lynn Temperton, songwriter, musician and producer, born 9 October 1949; death announced 5 October 2016\n",
      "Grimes live review – big bass, even bigger hooks It is only when you witness this much unfettered female joy on stage that you realise how rarely it is that you see it. Grimes’s feral K-pop rave is easily the best thing to be run through a mixing desk this year, maybe longer. It is every kind of awesome. Shrieks greet the atmospheric introductory passage, Laughing and Not Being Normal, that opens Grimes’s most recent album, Art Angels, and her set. Grimes – Claire Boucher, on her passport – then lets loose the Japanese-themed melody from Genesis, off her previous album, 2012’s Visions. Flanking her are two fierce dancers, Alison and Linda, who recall the Security of the First World, Public Enemy’s old pseudo-paramilitary helpmeets, crossed with ninjas. Soon, she’s unleashing gut-juddering sub-bass for Realiti, crunchier, and weirder than on record. She starts Flesh Without Blood off conducting the air, strumming a guitar riff and then singing about a false friendship in a bubblegum coo. “Got a doll that looks like you,” she smiles meaningfully. Bittersweet hook after bittersweet hook plays out on her gear. The bass is carnivorously loud; HANA, Boucher’s support act-cum-band member, whacks drum pads and tosses her plaited horsetail around. The tune is huge. Everywhere you look, there are women dancing. That pop music can be done with so much sweet, kaleidoscopic ferocity comes as a shock after a lifetime of regretfully accepting that the dead-eyed Britney version was the only way mainstream pop could work. There is no doubt that Miley Cyrus is having a ball, but you can still just see the marionette strings when she moves. Seeing Grimes tour Art Angels, her fourth and most accessible album (released last November), is like entering a parallel universe, where riot grrrl won the World Cup, where the K-pop-worshipping PC Music scene (Sophie et al) gained control of the means of production, currently hogged by a small cabal of producers who might not have the best interests of pop starlets at heart, where Peaches is as big as Madonna. Grimes the cult producer used to stay glued conscientiously to her equipment. In her new incarnation, she spends an hour bounding dementedly around, head-banging, running back to her workstation to start the next beat, play a keyboard line or trigger a sample. The stage set is as cheap as you like, what look like army surplus tarpaulins lit from beneath in lurid pinks and yellows, or strafed by lasers. When she’s not singing, Grimes cradles the microphone in the crook of her neck like a phone, both hands feverishly organising the live bits of the show’s playback. And so it goes on, euphorically, menacingly, with Grimes mixing what she calls “deep cuts” (mostly songs off her previous album, Visions) with the bulk of Art Angels, everything marinated in an enhancing dry rub of MSG cut with PCP. A big red bow controlling a mane of blond hair, lurid turquoise T-shirt over cut-offs, she is possessed by gleeful energy. Then, between songs, Grimes becomes Boucher, a nervous young Canadian woman, embarrassed at the repeated pauses she has to take because the crowd won’t stop cheering, even when she asks us nicely. “Stop it, it makes me stressed out, I’m very shy!” she blethers. Cue more screaming. The only thing to do is to start rapping in Russian – the vocal to Scream, originally in Mandarin, by Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes. Later in the set, for Venus Fly, the song’s martial rhythm section is multiplied tenfold. The build is monstrous; the drop, apocalyptic. The dancers have lasers shooting from their fingertips for a revamped version of Be a Body. For Go, a non-album cut that Grimes did with Blood Diamonds, they have daggers. Soon afterwards, Grimes apologises for having swallowed her own hair. Before Oblivion, she reminds us to hydrate, and not crush our peers. (The girl behind me has already fainted.) She plays her encore straight after the main set, because, thanks to her nerves, “Once I’m gone…” It’s easily the most explosive track off Art Angels, Kill V Maim, which may (or may not) be about The Godfather if he were a gender-bending vampire. It features the keynote chorus: “Hey, oh, don’t behave.” Hosting the pop rave of your dreams, Grimes and her crew are having a blast so palpable, so unrelenting, it actually feels like a game-changer.\n",
      "Mike Hart obituary The singer-songwriter Mike Hart, who has died aged 72, sang with the Liverpool band the Roadrunners, and was a member of the poetry and music collective Liverpool Scene, but he will be best remembered for his solo album Mike Hart Bleeds. Released by John Peel’s Dandelion label in 1969, it was an eccentric, defiant record by someone who was prepared to argue his corner. The song Aberfan berates celebrities for crying publicly at the tragedy in the Welsh mining village; Shelter Song criticises the church for not housing the homeless in its huge cathedrals; and Almost Liverpool 8 is a diatribe at the latest girl to leave in his extensive list of doomed relationships. Hart’s album was the antithesis of easy listening and his career was equally edgy: there can be few artists who have so consistently sabotaged their own success. Hart was born in Bebington, on the Wirral, son of Colin Hart, who ran a sailmakers’ business, William Hart & Co, and his wife, Beryl, and educated at Birkenhead school. In 1962 he formed the Roadrunners, a rhythm and blues band, which had residencies in Liverpool at Hope Hall (now the Everyman theatre) and the Cavern. Roger McGough claimed the group could perform Twist and Shout and Money better than the Beatles, and remembered Hart – “Arty” – as “the wild man in front … [who] was very popular with the ladies. He was weird-looking but he was very charismatic, a Jaggeresque thing.” In 1963, George Harrison told some Liverpool musicians that he had seen the Rolling Stones “who are almost as good as the Roadrunners”. Their tour de force was Cry, Cry, Cry, which Hart would perform passionately, his eyes tight shut as if reliving some past ordeal. Hart turned down management from Giorgio Gomelsky and also a recording contract with Fontana. If Hart said no, that was it. There is subsequently little of the Roadrunners on tape, save for a live set from the Star-Club in Hamburg and a fundraising EP in 1965 for Liverpool University rag week. After travelling with the band to York, Hart refused to play and said it was over. He then joined Liverpool Scene alongside the poet Adrian Henri, and the musicians Andy Roberts, Mike Evans, Percy Jones and Brian Dodson. Their first single was Hart’s witty, rasping song Son, Son (1968), in which everyone is too preoccupied to answer a child’s questions. “It was exposure to the poets that changed him and he found out how to express himself,” said Roberts, “but he wouldn’t tolerate things going wrong. He would throw his guitar against the wall if he had a bad gig.” The key track of the band’s 1968 album The Amazing Adventures of the Liverpool Scene was Hart’s bitter-sweet Gliders and Parks, where he hopes a girl will turn up for a date in Coronation Park in Crosby. Unexpectedly, she arrives and the track is over, a rare Hart song with a positive ending, although a drunken row is not far away. The song opens with the words, “Saturday, got a Ribble bus”, an example of how Hart chronicled daily life, a theme later taken up by Morrissey and Billy Bragg. Liverpool Scene were bohemians, but they recognised that some discipline had to prevail and Hart was too wayward to last beyond the first album. He returned to Liverpool and formed a duo for a while with the 17-year old Jude Kelly, now artistic director of the Southbank Centre. Another girl, this time from Belgium, appears on the cover of Mike Hart Bleeds. To create the image, Hart dripped his blood on her photograph and stubbed his cigarette out on his face, writing the liner note as if he were in an asylum. She is probably the subject of the track Arty’s Wife. “It is a brilliant title with a brilliant cover,” said McGough, “and I loved his heart-wrenching voice, but he lacked confidence and he would back away from opportunities. He couldn’t believe that people admired him. He didn’t trust that and maybe that is where the pain and the soul came from.” Although many thought of Hart as the Liverpool Dylan, the album was too raw to find a large audience. Hart moved to Edinburgh in 1971 and worked with actors around the fringe festival. This led to a second Dandelion album, Basher, Chalky, Pongo and Me (1972), which combined jokes and sketches with his strident songs, including one about a brief affair with the playwright Nell Dunn. His later songs were either unrecorded or exist in cheaply made demo recordings. Hart’s health deteriorated with constant drinking and he lost his memory. He spent his later years in a nursing home in Edinburgh. He is survived by a sister, Susan, two nephews and a niece. • Michael William Hart, singer and songwriter, born 3 December 1943; died 22 June 2016\n",
      "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back review – pecs, punchups and popcorn galore Tom Cruise is back in the role of Jack Reacher, badass military cop turned maverick civilian engaged in freelance pro bono asskicking. He is suffused with pimpernel mystery. At the end of an adventure, Reacher will stick his thumb out and hitchhike his way into the night. (At the end of Pulp Fiction, John Travolta is derisive about Samuel L Jackson’s ambition to “walk the earth” like Caine from the TV show Kung Fu on the grounds that he would just be a bum. But maybe he would be like Jack Reacher.) This is the second in Tom Cruise’s silly, entertaining Reacher franchise, and I was hoping he would marry a woman called Round and go for the double-barrelled surname. Instead, he monkishly refrains from sex but does pull a classic Cruise/Reacher move: semi-undressing in a motel room after a punchup, disclosing pecs which fall impressively on the right side of the moob borderline. An attractive woman also partially disrobes, flaunting a workaday bra strap. Another Reacher trope is the grumpy solo meal in the scuzzy cafe, which generally comes just before or after the biggest Reacher signature of all: beating the daylights out of five or six bullies whose sneery expressions and close-cropped goatees denote imminent victim status more clearly than red shirts on Star Trek crew. Cruise also gives us his some vintage sprinting — now as distinctive a trait as Nic Cage’s sudden shouting — as well as a bit of free climbing and some Olympic-quality ledge dangling. The story opens as Reacher has rather sweetly fallen for Lt Susan Turner, just through talking to her on the phone. She is played by Cobie Smulders (who plays Agent Maria Hill in the Avengers films). But when Jack shows up in Washington DC for their blind date, he is informed that Lt Turner has been arrested for espionage. Clearly she is the victim of a shady cover-up from corrupt top brass, and Reacher’s quietly furious demands to know what’s going on are undermined when the army claims he is the subject of a paternity case, and that he is the dad of a stroppy teen, Samantha (Danika Yarosh). Reacher is wrongly accused of murder by the crooked authorities, and in time-honoured style goes on the run, taking his quasi-spouse and daughter, while blowing the lid off a terrible conspiracy. The highlight of the first movie was its outrageous villain, played by Werner Herzog. I was hoping for a similar auteur bad guy in this one – surely Paul Verhoeven would have been a good sport? Well, there is no juicy high-concept baddie this time around, but there is a lot of enjoyable hokum and cheerful ridiculousness, especially when Reacher has to spring someone from military prison using his trademark combo of resourcefulness and punching. Popcornily preposterous and watchable.\n",
      "Viral video: David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Adele, Golden Globes This week was dominated by the untimely deaths of two stars – David Bowie and Alan Rickman. Both died at the age of 69, and both leave bodies of work that have been widely shared by their fans in the wake of their passing. Bowie’s death was marked by many fans with an animated GIF rather than a video – illustrator Helen Green’s striking drawings of the star’s hairstyles throughout his career. Created to mark the Thin White Duke’s 68th birthday, it became one of the defining image of his death almost exactly a year later. In terms of video, it’s impossible to give more than a taste here of Bowie’s legacy in video, from Space Oddity to Ashes to Ashes to the singles from his latest album Blackstar. Bowie videos broke Adele’s record for the most views in a day on video platform Vevo, with his clips watched 51 million times on Monday. They were led by Bowie’s most recent single, Lazarus, which features the opening line “Look up here, I’m in heaven / I’ve got scars that can’t be seen”. The lyrics took on a new resonance in the wake of the star’s death, while fans scoured the video for references to his career, with some pointing to the skull on the desk (also in the Blackstar promo) and others highlighting that his clothes as he gets into the wardrobe are was identical to an outfit from 1976’s The Man Who Fell To Earth. Arguably one of the best Bowie videos is also the simplest – Mick Rock’s 1971 promo for Life on Mars? Featuring the star with striking red hair and piercing blue eyeshadow, it allows his personality to shine straight through the screen. Fellow musicians’ tributes to Bowie also made waves this week, with Madonna singing Rebel Rebel live in Houston and Elton John performing a piano piece echoing Space Odyssey. Amid all the gloom surrounding Bowie’s death, it’s easy to forget that the singer had a great sense of humour and did a string of turns sending up his cool image, from a voice role in a Spongebob Squarepants movie to a cameo on Zoolander. Perhaps the best is his appearance in Ricky Gervais’s Extras, with the star mocking the comic as a “chubby little loser, national joke”. Here’s an interview in which Bowie gives a deadpan account of his cameo. Although he did his share of serious theatical roles, Rickman was also notable for his comic appearances. As well as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films, he played the deliciously evil Hans Gruber in Die Hard. But perhaps his most memorable comic appearance was as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, where he pretty much steals the show fom Kevin Kostner with lines such as “Locksley! I’ll cut your heart out with a spoon!” Another standout moment was Rickman’s voiceover for Marvin the robot in The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, a masterclass in comic misery. His line “I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed” echoed the feelings of many fans this week. Sunday’s Golden Globes provided plenty of headlines this week, from Ricky Gervais ribbing the audience to Jennifer Lawrence telling off a reporter for looking at his phone during a press conference. But the highlight for many viewers was the glimpse of Leonardo DiCaprio’s face as Lady Gaga brushed past on her way to pick up best actress for American Horror Story. His look of horror as the singer appears next to him is a million miles away from a Poker Face. Finally, the week’s most-shared video was Adele’s appearnce in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke slot. Hearing the Hello star belt out the Spice Girls’ Wannabe is a highlight while her rap of Nicki Minaj’s Monster shows her talents reach beyond singing. 1) Adele Carpool Karaoke She’s no wannabe 2) Leonardo DiCaprio vs Lady Gaga at the Golden Globes Shady behaviour 3) Saoirse Ronan Tries To Teach Stephen Colbert An Irish Accent Brooklyn brogue 4) EL VY & Stay Human Pay Tribute To David Bowie Let’s dance with Stephen Colbert 5) Snowboarding An Empty Water Park Liquid moves 6) The Path on Hulu Teaser Trailer #1 (Official) New show from Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul looks like cult viewing 7) Mulder, Scully and Jimmy Kimmel in The X-Files David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson embrace their return 8) 1 Day Old Sea Otter Trying to Sleep on Mom Cute overload 9) “Tonight Show Celebrity Photobomb” with Jimmy Fallon and Sesame Street Look out for the “double cookie” 10) Dog Knocks Another Dog Off of Couch Canine catastrophe\n",
      "HMV moves ahead of Tesco as second biggest entertainment retailer HMV has reclaimed is position as the second biggest entertainment retailer in the UK as high street chains enjoy a revival against their online competitors. HMV recorded a 2% year-on-year rise in sales of music, DVDs and games over the last quarter, giving it a market share of 16.9%, ahead of Tesco’s 16.1%. The figures represent HMV’s best performance since it collapsed into administration more than three years ago. It was eventually rescued by Hilco, the investment firm. Overall, sales of entertainment products in bricks-and-mortar shops fell by 2% during the 12 weeks to 10 April, according to Kantar Worldpanel. However, online retailers suffered a much larger decline, with sales down by 12%. Amazon, the country’s biggest entertainment retailer, saw its sales fall by 0.6% year-on-year, reducing its market share from 22.6% to 22%. Analysts said that high street entertainment stores were being underpinned by music and video games. One-in-four customers still only buy CDs, while 77% of video games were bought at shops during the quarter. Tesco and Game achieved their biggest share of video game sales for five years. This helped high street stores and supermarkets to claim 69.8% of spending on all physical entertainment products, up from 67.5% a year ago. Fiona Keenan, strategic insight director at Kantar, said: “Despite recent high profile casualties for high street fashion retailers the performance of bricks and mortar entertainment stores has demonstrated the strong appeal this channel still holds for consumers. “Some 14% of the population now has a music subscription service and paid-for Spotify subscriptions are growing at 25%. Yet the CD is still the most popular way to consume music content. “Such a strong performance from HMV has not been seen since it entered administration in 2013. HMV has really focused on creating an in-store environment that stimulates and excites consumers like it did in its heyday. “This focus is clearly reflected in the fact that over half of its sales this quarter came from customers who hadn’t planned to make a purchase – significantly higher than the market average of 38%.” Across the industry, music sales dipped by 1% during the period, with DVDs down 6% and games down 8%. Popular products include David Bowie’s albums Blackstar and Best of Bowie following his death in January, as well as the compilation Now That’s What I Call Music! 93 and Adele’s 25. The best-selling DVD during the period was Spectre, the latest James Bond film, which has sold more than 1.7m copies since it went on sale in February.\n",
      "Sampha review – a polite, pulsing performance cuts to the core Sampha’s always been about the voice. Diehard fans may have been following the 27-year-old producer and musician’s work since his 2010 Sundanza EP, but most listeners will know him more for the husky vocals slathered like a soothing paste on to other people’s singles. Whether adding depth to Jessie Ware’s 2013 single Valentine, landing the emotive suckerpunch on Drake co-write Too Much or lending longtime collaborator SBTRKT’s clubland tracks their hooks, Sampha’s distinctive vocal texture has become a brand of its own. In between songs tonight, that voice is initially polite. After kicking off with forthcoming debut album opener Plastic 100°C, he thanks the crowd for being here and gives a quick shout out to friends and family – really, he sounds more like a respectful birthday party host than headliner of a sold-out show on home turf. But once he and his band launch into their thumping, electrofunk rendition of Under, you remember just why he’s earned enough of a reputation to pack out a venue before he’s even released a solo album. He has a beautiful knack for combining what was originally seen as a “nu-soul” sensibility with deeply personal lyrical themes that cut right into the wobbly core of our vulnerabilities. The show undulates in energy, pulsing while he belts out Blood on Me, then pulling back to vocals-and-keys simplicity on Can’t Get Close and crowd-pleaser Too Much. And whenever the band sound momentarily shaky, Sampha whips out the trick that keeps it all together: that trembling, creaking, howling voice.\n",
      "Malcolm Middleton's playlist: Avicii, Ellie Goulding and more Betty Boo – Hangover A classic 90s pop song that I always return to. Her second album was pretty diverse and dark, I think this should’ve been the start of her career as a performer, not the end. She did continue writing for other folk, mind you. Avicii – Wake Me Up I hated this song for ages before lightening up and listening to it properly. It gets me every time, and I wish I could write songs like this, but with more personal lyrics. I guess I’ve tried to on Summer of ‘13, but I’m not quite there yet. My song Big Black Hole couldhave been an attempt at a massive pop hit if I’d taken Gordon [Anderson]’s advice and used the hook more. I’m too obtuse though. Tegan and Sara – I Was a Fool This also influenced Big Black Hole. I wanted some kind of pure, pristine, piano-led pop hook. I wrote the motif to fit a song I already had and then sourced some R&B presets – voila. I’m not a huge fan of these guys as, like always when I find a song I love by an artist, it turned out to be a one-off. Ellie Goulding – Burn When my son was born, we’d watch lots of early-morning music TV. This was always on. Not a great song, but the ideas seeped into what I was writing at the time. So yeah, I’m with the times (2013). The Good Natured – Wolves I don’t think this band exists anymore, or even released an album. But I love a lot of their early songs: no-nonsense pop, massive chorus, sense of urgency. They’ve been a big influence on me recently as they have such a stripped-back way of making great songs. It must be a sign of good songwriting.\n",
      "Here’s the Donald Trump bandwagon, and Rupert Murdoch nimbly leaping aboard Son James back in the saddle at Sky; Rebekah back running the greater Bun empire. Plus ça change in Murdoch land – including the boss’s proclivity for backing winners (when he knows who they are). Thus he backed Blair when Tony was up and coming. Thus his McBun lauds Scot Nats north of the border, while doing something quite different south of it. It’s a simple ploy. Find a bandwagon then clamber aboard, claiming alleged influence as you do so. Last September, the tweeting Rupert loved Ben Carson, not The Donald. He called it a choice “between a land of hope and a land of fear”. Back at the ranch, his Wall Street Journal editorialists faithfully roasted Trump’s candidacy: Trump-loving conservative media were “hurting the cause”, they said. “If Donald Trump becomes the voice of conservatives, conservatism will implode along with him.” But now the Journal’s editorials sing a strangely different tune. “Mr Trump is a better politician than we ever imagined, and he is becoming a better candidate… He might possibly be able to appeal to a larger set of voters than he has so far.” And so on and oleaginously forth, while the greater tweeting Murdoch sings descant. “Trump appeals across party lines – surely the winning strategy.” The Donald, in short, looks more like a winner. Better fall into line fast (unless the row over Fox debates gets really out of hand). Mr M – risibly joining in the tax campaign against Google – likes to play global power broker in the world of short-term memory.\n",
      "The Simpsons imagines the terrors of Trump as president in fake election ad America’s first family has finally weighed in on the upcoming presidential election. No, not the Obamas, who made their feelings plain at the Democratic convention last week – the Simpsons. The long-running Fox comedy show released a short clip on YouTube late on Sunday night, showing Homer and Marge Simpson watching a political advertisement on late-night television in order to settle who they plan to vote for. The ad in question follows the format of Hillary Clinton’s famous “3am” spot from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, with a severe voiceover asking the animated couple “who [they] want answering the call”. In one version, the proverbial 3am call is answered by former president Bill Clinton, who is ruefully forced to admit that the call is for his wife. “From now on, it’s always for me,” the former secretary of state snaps at her husband. But the most scathing humor of the spot is saved for Donald Trump, portrayed as a pasty, bald autocrat reading a book of Adolf Hitler’s speeches when the call comes in. “Not now – I’m on Twitter!” Trump says, before mocking Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he apparently has exiled from the United States. After instructing his lackeys to put his name on the Lincoln Memorial, disband Nato and “make Chris Christie eat a worm just for laughs”, Trump finally answers the phone call requesting his immediate presence in the Situation Room, but requires a pit crew of beauticians to attend to his appearance before he leaves. Eight and a half hours later, after a spray tan, collagen injections, the application of large prosthetic hands and the placement of a small dog on his head, Trump is finally ready – but too late to stop the advance of Chinese military vessels. “Just build another wall!” Trump commands. “Yes, in the ocean – loser.” Following the ad, paid for by “Americans Who Are Really Starting to Miss Obama,” Homer and Marge both decide to vote for Clinton – although oafish Homer still has his doubts.\n",
      "Slow Club: One Day All of This Won’t Matter Any More review – a musical and artistic stop-gap Charles Watson and Rebecca Taylor relocated to Matthew E White’s Spacebomb Studios in Virginia to make their fourth album. While escaping familiar locations has served to align their sound with world-weary Americana – enhanced here by White’s in-house band – there is something amiss: the friction that once made their music blossom has gone. After their last album set out some lofty ambitions, this one feels like a creative plateau. Album closers Let the Blade Do the Work and One Day All of This Won’t Matter Anymore provide the right balance of pop romance and crooked storytelling; while heartache and an endearing comedic narrative still shape their lyrics, sometimes the country crooning leans into boozy bar karaoke – or floats, coasts and billows past without making any real connection. Warm and nourishing, but bereft of an artistic statement, In Waves feels like a musical stop gap – a temporary vacation rather than a home.\n",
      "Barack Obama's workout playlist proves he's master of the eclectic mixtape The US Democratic party have championed Barack Obama’s hip and eclectic music taste since sharing the nominee’s iPod playlist during the 2008 campaign. Now, as the president winds down his final term, he’s revealed his curatorial powers extend to a particularly 21st century obsession: the well-crafted workout playlist. For his guest editorship of November’s Wired magazine, Obama’s team released his exercise soundtrack on Tuesday: a mixture of funk, pop, rock and hip-hop, with a few curveballs (and cheeseballs) thrown in. The playlist shares a few commonalities with his 2016 summer soundtrack: there’s a celebration of black artists, a few crowdpleasers (last year’s Good Vibrations is this year’s Let’s Get It Started), and even a couple of double-ups – independent Australian artist Courtney Barnett’s Elevator Operator features on both playlists, as does Nina Simone’s Sinnerman. Jay Z gets another look-in, this time with Drake in 2009’s Off That. It’s preceded by Get Me Bodied by Beyoncé – who featured twice on Michelle Obama’s workout playlist, released in 2012. Also featured is Emergency by Swedish electropop duo Icona Pop – a more original choice than 2012’s I Love It, which remains unavoidable in gyms around the world; the Isley Brothers’ funk-filled ode to free love, Live It Up; and, from slightly out of left field, there’s Perro Loco by Forro in the Dark – a collective of Brazilian musicians who rework the rural forro music for the club scene of New York. Obama – who hosted his first ever music festival, South by South Lawn (SXSL), earlier this month – proved himself a master of the mixtape when he released the White House’s summer playlists in August to broad acclaim. Speaking with Pitchfork at SXSL, the White House’s first chief digital officer Jason Goldman said the choices are all the president’s: “I swear it is him who makes the playlists. He has personally selected all of those songs and writes them out by hand. He really loves a diverse range of music.” In 2015, Obama became the first sitting president to visit Jamaica in more than 30 years. Dropping in at the Bob Marley Museum, he told press he’d been “a big fan” since high school. This might explain the gym playlist inclusion of Could You Be Loved which, much like Sting’s If You Love Somebody Set Them Free, is perhaps more befitting of a dawdle than a gym drill. But perhaps it’s one for the warm-down. The playlist does, however, not include Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper, who were recently invited to his Final State Dinner. Have a listen to his picks below.\n",
      "AC/DC's Brian Johnson: hearing loss diagnosis was darkest day of my career AC/DC’s Brian Johnson has revealed further details about why he had to stop playing live with the band. His statement comes in the same week that it was announced that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose will take over Johnson’s duties during AC/DC’s forthcoming live shows. Johnson made it clear that he wasn’t retiring from recording with the band, but that his health had made playing live shows impossible. In a statement he said: “On March 7th, after a series of examinations by leading physicians in the field of hearing loss, I was advised that if I continued to perform at large venues I risked total deafness. While I was horrified at the reality of the news that day, I had for a time become aware that my partial hearing loss was beginning to interfere with my performance on stage … and because I was not able to hear the other musicians clearly, I feared the quality of my performance could be compromised. This was something I could not, in good conscience, allow. Our fans deserve my performance to be at the highest level, and if for any reason I can’t deliver that level of performance I will not disappoint our fans or embarrass the other members of AC/DC.” Johnson was at pains to point out that he wasn’t a “quitter” and that there is nothing he’d like more than to be able to continue playing live with the group. “I like to finish what I start. Nevertheless, the doctors made it clear that I had no choice but to stop performing on stage for the remaining shows and possibly beyond. That was the darkest day of my professional life.” He added that it was possible he could continue at some point in the future: “Since that day, I have had several consultations with my doctors and it appears that, for the near future, I will be unable to perform on stage at arena and stadium-size venues where the sound levels are beyond my current tolerance without the risk of substantial hearing loss and possibly total deafness. I tried as best as I could to continue despite the pain and hearing loss, but it became too much to bear and too much to risk.” Johnson said doctors had confirmed he could continue to record in the studio with the band: “And I intend to do that. For the moment, my entire focus is to continue medical treatment to improve my hearing. I am hoping that in time my hearing will improve and allow me to return to live concert performances. While the outcome is uncertain, my attitude is optimistic. Only time will tell.” Axl Rose, 54, will fulfil his current commitments to Guns N’ Roses before replacing Johnson on AC/DC’s remaining tour dates. The last couple of years have been difficult for AC/DC. In July 2015, they parted company with drummer Phil Rudd after he was convicted of threatening to kill and possession of drugs. Rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young left in September 2014 after announcing he had dementia.\n",
      "Aria awards 2016: Flume dominates with 11 nominations The Australian electronic producer Harley Streten, best known as Flume, has swept the nominations for the 2016 Aria awards, shortlisted for 11 categories in total – and already winning in three. Flume’s second album, Skin, which he is touring through the US and Europe, won in all three artisan categories on Wednesday: best producer, engineer and cover art of the year. Appearing over video message, he also announced that he will be performing at the November ceremony, where he will be competing for the night’s top awards – including album of the year, best male artist, best dance release and the Apple Music song of the year – a new category voted for by Apple Music subscribers. In 2013 the producer was nominated in seven categories for his debut self-titled record, and won in four. Speaking to Australia this year, Flume described the follow-up process as “incredibly stressful”. “I put a lot of pressure on myself to have my music at a certain quality, and that wasn’t a positive thing,” he said. “Skin was a totally different experience than the first record. It didn’t just come.” The 2016 nominations were also dominated by YouTube star-turned-pop artist Troye Sivan, who was nominated for two artisan awards and will be competing with Flume in five categories on the night: artist of the year, male artist, pop release, Apple Music song of the year and best video. Released last year, Sivan’s debut album, Blue Neighbourhood, was awarded five stars by the Australian music critic Everett True. “Sivan and his equally youthful co-writer-producer, Alex Hope, have such a natural flair for capturing the sound of now that in a year’s time he could well be sharing the stratosphere with Taylor Swift,” True wrote. The pop artist Sia, the hip-hop artist Illy and the long-awaited return of the Avalanches have brought in six nominations apiece, with King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, RÜFÜS and Violent Soho each nominated in five categories. Courtney Barnett, who was nominated for eight Arias in 2015 and won four, is up for two public-voted categories in 2016: best video for Elevator Operator, and best live act. Awards announced at the nominations announcement also included best comedy album (Roy & HG, for This Sporting Life), best world music album (Melbourne Ska Orchestra for Sierra Kilo Alpha), best original soundtrack/cast/show album (Josh Pyke & The Sydney Symphony Orchestra for Live at the Sydney Opera House), best jazz album (Vince Jones & Paul Grabowsky for Provenance) and best classical album (Flight Facilities for Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra). Crowded House will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at the ceremony, which will be held on 23 November at the Star Casino in Sydney and broadcast on Channel Ten.\n",
      "Shakin' Stevens: 'I'm like a skittle. If I get knocked down I get back up again' Hi Shaky! Should people be surprised that the biggest name in 80s chart-topping rockabilly pop has made an album of socially conscious, dark Americana? (1) People have been surprised. We’ve been playing it to them and not telling them who it is. I’m really pleased with it. Why is it so dark? I got to a certain age and realised I knew nothing about my family history, ’cos when you’re growing up it’s all hush hush. So I started digging around and it was shocking. One of my ancestors was blown up in the first world war. It took him eight days to die. My grandfather was a copper miner at the age of 10. They’d spend hours on these ladders going down the hole. They were working in prison, no toilets. A lot went on as well, which we won’t go into. Some of them were so tired at the end of the day that they’d fall off the ladders and never wake up. So the stories lent themselves to blues, gospel, Cajun and mandolins. Mind you, wasn’t the apparently cheery This Ole House (2) based on a similarly grim story? Stuart Hamblen wrote it [in 1954] about coming across the body of a prospector in a deserted shack. True story. Do you think the squillions who bought Green Door had any idea about the persistent urban myth that it was about a lesbian club (3)? I never knew that. Lovely. That’s quite subversive really. Nick Lowe recommended I cover the song after we bumped into him in the pub. I always wondered why he was smiling. You’ve got environmental songs on the new album. Are you a bit of a politico on the sly? There’s that infamous story about you being in the Communist party … In the very early days the guy that got us our gigs was in the Communist party. Or his parents were. So we ended up doing gigs for them. I’m not really political, but I am aware of what’s going on. How did young Michael Barratt, milkman, builder and upholsterer, turn into Shakin’ Stevens? A friend of mine called Steven Vanderwalker used to call himself Shakin’ Steven. I thought: “That’s something you wont forget.” So my band became Shakin’ Stevens and the Sunsets. What was it like doing raw, raucous rock’n’roll in the era of prog rock, punk and disco? Wild. John Peel came to our gigs. We’d play places like the Hope and Anchor [in north London], turn up in the van, slide the gear down the chute, do the gig, all sweaty, then find a car park to sleep in the van. None of this X Factor nonsense. Your big career break came in the theatre, playing the young Elvis in the West End (4), didn’t it? I was starving. The Sunsets had set. It was time for me to move on. I loved every minute of it. I just took my stage act into Elvis, standing on the back of the seats and stuff. In those days, I’d arrive at gigs, look at the girders and think “I’ll be up there tonight.” It wasn’t unknown for me to walk along the bar, with the microphone stuck down the sax player’s wotsit. How did you come across the song Marie Marie, which was previously released on a tiny indie label, performed by an underground band who played with the likes of Black Flag, X and Fear on the LA punk circuit? The Blasters! I was in America working. We had some time to kill, ended up at this guy’s flat while he played records and that was one. I thought: “That’s a great song. I’ll have that.” The rest is history. And before long you were the biggest selling British singles artist of the 80s. (5) I was a 17-year overnight success really. I think I earned it. Is it a crazy existence when you’re that big? There was that infamous incident when you attacked Richard Madeley on live TV, wasn’t there? I’d been doing endless radio and TV stuff. I’d been there since early in the morning, all the interview questions were really badly researched and I just thought, “This is ludicrous” and leapt on him on the sofa. He was going: “Oh my watch, oh my hair!” On the recording you can hear fellow guests Status Quo going “You’re mad, you are.” There’s nothing wrong with being mad. I met Richard again years later and he said: “What a prat I was.” When the hits eventually dried up, you made some unlikely records: disco, funk covers and such. I was trying to find my way really. It’s healthy for artists to move on. I didn’t have a manager that would come up with ideas, so I did stuff like [the Detroit Emeralds’] Feel the Need in Me and [the Supremes’] Come See About Me. I wasn’t really happy with a lot of them. The people who signed me at record companies kept leaving. It was like being a footballer when they change the manager. In 2002, you were banned for drink driving and had to attend the Gloucester drink and drug counselling service. I’d been working and staying in this hotel, which was just down the lane. Either the police were waiting or someone told on me. It was two or three minutes’ drive, but the wrong thing to do. Silly. Did the police recognise you? I’m sure they did, but they treated me like anyone else. They didn’t ask you to sing Green Door? Ha. I never thought of doing that, but I was out of it, so I wouldn’t have remembered the words. Was your 2010 heart attack really caused by “strenuous gardening”? I’d been picking up bags of stones. I knew something was wrong. I fell asleep and didn’t wake up. Luckily my partner found me and called the ambulance. If I’d been alone I’d have been a goner. You’re the only person I’ve ever spoken to who’s had their body frozen. To slow my metabolism. I had an ice hat on, ice under my arms, wires everywhere. But here I am. And looking great. Did the brush with the reaper give you a new sense of urgency? Yeah and I realised you’ve got to look after your body. I’ve been drunk like anyone else. I just woke up one morning and thought: “That’s it, no more drinking.” I just have a glass of wine. Or a couple of glasses of wine. What can people expect on your forthcoming tour (6)? I’d rather bang my head on the ceiling than do those rewind shows, reliving the 80s. I still do the hits – not all of them – but in a different way. There’s a lot more to come out of me. I feel like I’m a skittle. If I’m knocked down, I’ll get up and try again. I don’t want to ever stop. I still really enjoy singing. Now you’re an Americana artist, will you get a check shirt and beard? I never dressed like a teddy boy, and I don’t like shaving but you’ve got to do it. I don’t think a beard and moustache would suit me very much, do you? (1) Echoes of Our Times is released on 16 September. (2) Which spent three weeks at No 1 in 1981. (3) The myth is Bob Davie and Martin Moore’s 1956 song refers to Gateways, London’s first lesbian club, which had a green door. It’s almost certably not true. (4) Elvis! had a two-year run from 1977 to 1979. (5) Shaky has notched up 33 Top 40 hits in the UK. (6) Shakin’ Stevens tours next year.\n",
      "Readers recommend playlist: your songs about religion Below is this week’s playlist – the theme and tunes picked by a reader from the comments below in last week’s callout. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the format of the weekly Readers recommend series at the end of the piece. According to former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, “reason has been a part of organised religion ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake”. You may or may not agree with this, but it’s certainly true religion has inspired artists and musicians for centuries, and – trying, perhaps, to disprove the old maxim that “the Devil has the best tunes” – below is a playlist of my favourites from your suggestions this week. Firstly, one that some listeners might wish to fast forward through is Decree 10.05 by Church Universal and Triumphant, Inc. feat Elizabeth Clare Prophet. It’s 20-plus minutes of invocation about Heaven knows what. An extraordinary track, if a little disturbing. More traditional is Tennessee Ernie Ford’s call for a dose of That Old Time Religion, so, ever ready to oblige, we follow on with some old-time religion in the shape of Wardruna’s Rotlaust Tre Fell, a piece of Scandinavian folk music that draws upon Norse mythology for inspiration. Iron Maiden, restrained as ever, remind us that the Number of the Beast is 666. There are complex explanations as to why this particular number was chosen as beastly, but personally I think it was selected because it looks nice ... People can get “religious” about all sorts of things. For OPM it’s skateboarding, leading to Heaven Is a Halfpipe. Each to their own and all that. Jello Biafra’s Lard offer us some Hellfudge, next. I think I had some of that once – it was kind of chewy ... And then we have hippy favourites Quintessence, who hedge their bets, perhaps wisely, with Jesus Buddha Moses Gauranga. Sensible chaps. God makes many things – all things, in fact, according to some – so it’s no surprise that he made Philou Louzolo funky. His Phunky Coogi is a delightful piece of praise in musical form. Withered Hand (Scottish indie rock musician Dan Wilson) earns his place thanks to the wonderful line “Knocking on Kevin’s door” in Religious Songs, I am a sucker for a good (or bad?) pun. Bringing up the rear this week, it has to be Kana Uemura with Toilet no Kamisama (“God of Toilet”). It’s a song about both “god” and toilets and yet so much more (for more on the lyrics see a translation provided in the comments by HoshinoSakura). There really is a lesson in “Zen” here: how the mundane daily task can, if carried out in the right spirit, bring us closer to the divine. It’s a lovely, toilety, tune too ... Note: not all songs appear on this Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on the service. New theme The theme for next week’s playlist will be announced at 8pm (UK time) on 6 October. You have until 11pm on 10 October to submit nominations.

      "Marillion – 10 of the best 1. Forgotten Sons Marillion were still defining their sound when they recorded their first album, 1983’s Script for a Jester’s Tear. While they’d already got crude pastiches of Supper’s Ready out of their system, the dramatic album closer still displays strong echoes of Genesis’s The Knife and Pink Floyd’s Comfortably Numb. The tale of a young soldier caught up in the Troubles in Northern Ireland remains an intense and moving piece that transcends its rather obvious influences. In archetypal neo-progressive fashion, it builds through multiple sections, with a Psalm 23/Lords’ Prayer spoken-word part backed by a staccato riff stolen from Gustav Holst’s Mars, the Bringer of War, and a powerful closing section demonstrating Fish’s growing powers as a lyricist. A high water mark of early 80s neo-prog, it’s a song that’s far more than the sum of its parts. 2. Incubus Marillion’s second album, Fugazi, saw them leaving behind the notion that they were merely a pastiche of Gabriel-era Genesis, with a dense, layered sound that was far more their own. Driven by a propulsive riff, Incubus is a highlight, a song about revenge porn written three decades before it became a regular news item. While the lyrics are perhaps a little overblown, Fish’s half-sung, half-ranted vocal gets disturbingly into the role of the jealous ex-lover of a celebrity. It still features regularly in Fish’s live sets as a solo artist. 3. Warm Wet Circles/That Time of the Night Marillion hit the big time with the intense and personal-concept album Misplaced Childhood, which spawned their big hit single, Kayleigh. When it came to the follow-up, Clutching at Straws, they took a sharp left turn. Gone were the sprawling, serpentine song structures and opaque, overcooked lyrics, in favour of a more focused songwriting approach that would set the template for Fish’s later solo career. I know treating these two as one song is cheating a bit, but they work as one continuous piece, with Steve Rothery’s sublime solo forming the bridge between. When performed live, either by Fish or by the current incarnation of Marillion, they’re almost always played together. 4. Seasons End Just when Marillion seemed poised to conquer the world, the unthinkable happened. Burned out by constant touring without downtime and with divisions over musical direction beginning to surface, Fish left the band. Rather than trying to find a soundalike, they recruited the relatively unknown Steve Hogarth and used his very different vocal approach as an opportunity to reinvent themselves. Seasons End was the result. The title track is both soaring and anthemic, yet it is one of the saddest in their songbook. It is one of those songs that never fails to bring a lump to the throat. A perfect marriage of Hogarth’s vocals and Rothery’s lyrical lead guitar. 5. The Great Escape After the singles from 1991’s pop-oriented Holidays in Eden failed to make the charts, the band launched a follow-up in 1994 with Brave, a dark and intense concept album with no obvious single, which remains a firm fan-favourite. Inspired by a news report of a girl with amnesia found wandering on the Severn Bridge, the narrative imagines a life story that might have bought someone to that place. The emotional climax of the album is the penultimate song, with musical motifs repeated from earlier in the album. The point when it changes gears is one of those moments. When they played the album in full at the 2013 fan convention, The Great Escape prompted a five-minute standing ovation. 6. Out of This World Marillion have a thing about death and water. It’s a recurring theme that goes right back to Chelsea Monday, from their debut. Out of This World comes from the album Afraid of Sunlight, whose songs reflect the flipside of fame. It tells the story of Donald Campbell’s fatal attempt at the world water speed record in Bluebird in 1967, and the song itself was to inspire the recovery of the wreck of Bluebird from the depths of Coniston Water. This one’s a showcase for Steve Hogarth’s vocals, and aside from Steve Rothery’s magnificent solo the song owes far more to Talk Talk than it does to Pink Floyd or Genesis. 7. Man of a Thousand Faces While latter-day Marillion are known for their atmospheric epics, sometimes they do write straightforward pop songs, and this one, from 1997’s This Strange Engine is one of their best, a semi-acoustic song with 12-string guitar and a delightful piano solo from Mark Kelly. By this point in their career they’d been dropped by EMI, and though Man of a Thousand Faces was released as a single, it got no radio airplay and didn’t chart. 8. This Is the 21st Century Marillion go trip-hop. The 2001 album Anoraknophobia comes from the period when Marillion were experimenting with many different musical ideas and directions in an attempt to avoid repeating their own past, and drew comparisons with the more contemporary sounds of Radiohead and Massive Attack. The album was also hugely significant for the wider music business as the first successfully crowdfunded record, something for which Marillion don’t always get the credit they deserve. This lengthy number was a high spot of the album, with a lyric serving a powerful rebuttal to the reductionist worldview of Richard Dawkins, who allowed no space for the spiritual. 9. Neverland The late 90s and early years of the new century saw a tension between the more contemporary side of their music and the classic Marillion sound centred on Steve Rothery’s distinctive, overdriven guitar. The sprawling double album version of 2004’s Marbles kept a foot in both camps, balancing lighter reflective songs with the 18-minute epic Ocean Cloud. The album comes to close with the anthemic Neverland, which begins as plaintive piano ballad and ends in a glorious wall of sound, monstrous waves of molten guitar as Steve Rothery duels with Steve Hogarth using his voice as a lead instrument. It’s been a live favourite ever since, with good reason. 10. The New Kings Most bands who have been around for almost four decades have long since burned out creatively, and if they still tour they’ve largely turned into their own tribute acts. It’s possible that the change of singer just at the point where they reached their creative peak is the secret to their longevity, but whatever the reason, Marillion still have something to say. From the elegiac opening chords onwards, the five-part epic that closes their 16th album, Fear, demonstrates this in spades, a lament for a world screwed over by corrupt self-serving elites. “Do you remember a country that cared for you? / A national anthem you could sing without feeling used or ashamed? / Now we’re living for the new kings”, sings Hogarth as the musical twists and turns show all the strengths of Marillion’s music from the 21st century.\n",
      "The Fall review – a long-running feud in every sense This somewhat thin documentary revisits a story of athletic rivalry that marked the careers of two runners and in some ways overshadowed their other achievements. The reigning queen of the track, the American Mary Decker had yet to win an Olympic medal. Her main challenger was Zola Budd, a teenage South African who ran barefoot and was raised on a farm. The press scented a story and, after Budd was controversially granted British citizenship in order to compete in the 1984 Olympic Games, did everything it could to stir up tension between them. Disaster struck when the pair collided and Decker fell, later blaming Budd for the incident. In fact, the film argues, the media had most cause to feel guilty. A belated reunion between the two athletes reveals little about either.\n",
      "Harry Rabinowitz obituary For half a century the orchestral conductor and composer Harry Rabinowitz, who has died aged 100, played a key role in the British broadcasting and film industries. He was in charge of popular and light music for both the BBC and London Weekend Television and conducted the music for more than 60 films. Rabinowitz often said that he never wished to “waste his colleagues’ time” and was opposed to over-rehearsing. Although he was highly professional, he was not a dictatorial conductor, telling an interviewer that “in almost all the sessions I’ve conducted, the musicians have left smiling”. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Israel and Eva, he went to Athlone high school and the University of the Witwatersrand, where he studied the piano and composition. He was fired from his first job, as a jewellery salesman, after only one day and next found work demonstrating new songs to customers in the sheet music department of a Johannesburg store. Following a period in the South African army during the second world war, he conducted the orchestra for the musical Strike a New Note before travelling to London in 1946 to take up a place on the conducting course at the Guildhall School of Music. With the help of the actor and comedian Sid James, a fellow South African, Rabinowitz found his feet in the British music business. He played the piano for the popular BBC radio show Variety Band- box and was a session musician at EMI’s Abbey Road recording studios. His conducting career began in earnest when he was hired to work on the musical Golden City in 1950. Written by Philip Tore, the show was set in the South African gold rush of 1886. This led to work at seasonal ice shows at the Empress Hall in Earl’s Court, London, and, in 1953, as musical director of the London production of Lerner and Loewe’s Broadway hit Paint Your Wagon. Next, Rabinowitz was offered a contract to conduct the BBC Revue Orchestra. This was a house band of the Light Programme and could be heard on such shows as Variety Playhouse, Henry Hall’s Guest Night and the Jimmy Edwards comedy series Take It From Here. He could also be heard as a pianist on Midday Music Hall and Piano Playtime. In 1960, Rabinowitz was appointed music director of BBC TV light entertainment, at a time when variety and comedy shows requiring orchestral accompaniment dominated the schedules. In addition to conducting the orchestra for the Val Doonican Show, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore’s Not Only... But Also and many others, he composed music for The Frost Report (1966). Rabinowitz then moved to a similar post at the newly established London Weekend Television (1968-77). There he worked on Upstairs, Downstairs (1971) and Black Beauty (1972). His theme music for Love for Lydia (1977) was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. By now, his reputation as a conductor and arranger of popular and light music was sufficiently high for him to pursue a freelance career in theatre, films and broadcasting, where he went on to compose music for the TV series the Agatha Christie Hour (1982) and Reilly: Ace of Spies (1983). In the theatre, Rabinowitz conducted the orchestra at the premiere of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and TS Eliot musical Cats (1981) and Don Black and Lloyd Webber’s Song and Dance the following year. He was in even greater demand to work in films, in one year (1991) recording music for nine movies. His cinema credits included Chariots of Fire (1981), The Remains of the Day (1993), Howards End (1992), The English Patient (1996) and The Talented Mr Ripley (1999). His final film score assignment, at the age of 87, was Cold Mountain (2003). Rabinowitz’s renown as a conductor of film and light music spread to the US and led to seven seasons’ work as guest conductor with the Boston Pops Orchestra, beginning in 1985. He also appeared at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1980s, as well as occasional concerts with the London Symphony and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras. In 1996, he conducted a concert at Carnegie Hall, New York, of music from the films of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory. He was appointed MBE in 1977 and in 1985 received the Gold Badge of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Last year Rabinowitz became one of the oldest guests on Desert Island Discs at the age of 99, choosing a pitch pipe as his luxury item. In recent years, Rabinowitz divided his time between Provence and Portland, Oregon, the home town of his second wife, Mitzi Scott, whom he married in 2001. She survives him, as do three children, Karen, Simon and Lisa, from his first marriage, to Lorna Anderson, which ended in divorce, and four grandchildren. • Harry Rabinowitz, conductor and composer, born 26 March 1916; died 22 June 2016 • This article was amended on 24 June 2016. Harry Rabinowitz died on 22 June, not 21 June, as originally stated. His children are Karen, Simon and Lisa, rather than Karen, Simon and Oliver.\n",
      "I’m getting over my post-Brexit meltdown For me, the first sign of recovery from post-Brexit shock was the sudden and unexpected return of my sense of humour and perspective. It started when I progressed to not feeling quite such an urge to plead with people to sign endless online petitions, which, at any rate, were becoming so numerous that they were in grave danger of outnumbering the 48% of Remainers who were signing them. My petition Tourette’s under control, it was time to slap my own face several times to get rid of any lingering “dual nationality” fantasies. My insomnia has improved too – I only wake to see Boris Johnson’s face appearing in the pattern on the bedroom curtains a few times a night now. Sadly, the nocturnal visions of a tiny, capering Nigel Farage are still going strong… Some of the above – endless petitions, insomnia– you might have experienced yourself, while other parts – visions of Farage and Johnson – with luck, you haven’t. Fact is, I crumbled post-Brexit. While others got to work (a magazine called the New European was created and published within a week), I came to typify the archetypal, foot-stamping, ineffectual Remain casualty, a veritable Violet Elizabeth Bott of the handwringing liberal echo chamber. I have no excuse for this. I suppose it was just the shock of feeling that I’d gone to sleep in one country and woken up in another. All those signifiers, big and small, that something important had been broken and something ugly was gaining strength got to me. Marine Le Pen gloating at the result. The 3,000 new hate crimes in England and Wales. The pound plummeting like a reckless tombstoner – you’ve all seen the news. Now that the “liberal panic” is settling, the Leave camp has some explaining to do – if we could find any of them. They’ve been vanishing one by one, as though in some surreal Agatha Christie whodunnit (from what I can make out, Liz Hurley is in charge now). Has anyone concocted a Leave plan yet or is it still: “We’re taking our country back – and fingers crossed we can be Norway”? The only point I’ve seen Leavers make with any fervour is that Remainers should stop being “sore losers” and accept democracy. Would that be the same kind of “sore loser” that Farage said he’d be if Leave lost by a similar minuscule margin? Is democracy now defined by the many Leave voters regretting their “protest vote”, realising that they were lied to by squabbling politicians? Despite everything, I refuse to believe that the provincial working class, the kind of people I grew up among, are either stupid or racist. Not only were Leave voters brazenly (unlawfully) lied to, they were also abandoned to their fate by an opposition party that should have been robustly campaigning and informing, rather than what amounted to strategic ineffectiveness. The same Labour party that is led by a man who at best comes across as a sparkly eyed competition winner who can’t quite believe all the attention he’s getting (and doesn’t look like volunteering to return to backbench obscurity just yet). Shame on Jeremy Corbyn for enabling this shoddy, contaminated Brexit – for me, this amounts to yet another last straw. Indeed, embarrassed though I am by my post-Brexit meltdown, I feel positively chipper now, so much so that, like many others I’ve spoken to, I’m considering giving my vote, perhaps even membership fees, to the party (Liberal Democrats?) most committed to finding a way out of this mess. Looking back on this tumultuous fortnight, I can’t help but feel that people like me might not have felt so “lost” had we believed that our views were being politically represented. Less bull about Pamplona’s bull run, please Five people were gored during the yearly running of the bulls at Pamplona’s San Fermin festival. Please forgive me, but, just for a split second, a part of me thought: “Good.” Of course it isn’t good (may the injured make swift recoveries). However, the Pamplona bull run is a cruel, disgusting custom that deeply shames its host nation every year. Popularised by Ernest Hemingway, it’s become a test of machismo for men who ironically seem too dumb to have read The Sun Also Rises. Others blather about tradition, but who has the patience for tradition where animal cruelty is concerned? Britain used to have bearbaiting and cockfighting. Anyone fancy getting those charming, folksy pastimes back? A good rule of thumb with such matters is to ask: if a particular custom had completely died out, would a revival be permitted? If the answer is no, then why in any humane world should it continue? At a time when it’s rumoured that foxhunting may be about to make a reappearance on the British political agenda, it seems important to know exactly where you stand on bloodsports and the “traditions” that excuse them. Three-fifths of Girl Power? No thanks Emboldened by their 20th anniversary, the Spice Girls are planning another reunion jaunt. However, it looks as though they might be missing Mel Chisholm (undecided) and Victoria Beckham (very decided… against). Hence they’re said to be toying with the new name Gem, representing the initials of the remaining trio, Geri (Halliwell), Emma (Bunton) and Melanie (Brown). I would strongly advise against this. First, a change of moniker is unnecessary as many acts have re-formed with key personnel missing, as evidenced by the myriad ugly squabbles over rights to band names. Out of friendship, loyalty and decency (and perhaps just a teeny weeny bit of sheer boredom, laced with icy contempt), neither Beckham nor Chisholm seems interested in fighting the trio over the use of the name, so what’s the point of changing it? As the depleted Spice Girls (possible tagline for posters: “At least one less with her microphone turned off by a discreet roadie!”), the band could at least hope to make a packet on the thriving retro-music circuit, and good luck to them. As Gem, with the same personnel, I’m not so sure. I even feel slightly afraid for them. As the Spice Girls, there’s exciting talk of a huge show in Hyde Park; as Gem, I’m envisioning tragic, increasingly desperate personal appearances, say, outside branches of Morrisons, with staff handing around paper plates of pork pies with union jack skewers in them (to echo Geri’s famous dress) or, worse, some microwaved congealing Pop-Tarts (geddit?). This is the sort of thing that happens when a strong brand doesn’t recognise its own value and inevitability. If the remaining Spices aren’t careful, they could end up being wannabes to their own legacy.\n",
      "Pop culture is now a rich kids’ playground To John Harris’s misgivings about the affordability of pop culture (Pop music was a great leveller, 16 November) might be added misgivings about who’s making it. The children of the rich are increasingly dominating the popular arts. The writers of the popular culture explosion of the late 50s and 60s came from the backgrounds that they wrote about, and its musicians, photographers and stylists grew up with one foot in the street and the other in art school. Even grammar school products like Mick Jagger were a bit of a rarity. If this continues, we will end up with a fossilised popular arts scene dominated in drama by modern-day Cowards and Rattigans, and in music without the periodic kick-starts provided by the Beatles and punk.

      "Cruz found out how to best Trump in a debate. But it's the end of their bromance The Ted Cruz and Donald Trump love story – don’t call it a “bromance”, now that Carly Fiorina’s used the word – is over. It was a short-lived and incredibly well-documented political phenomenon that began last month when Trump conspicuously held his punches against Cruz in a debate, and Cruz happily returned the favor. Conventional wisdom held that Cruz was positioning himself as Trump’s best friend. And indeed, if Trump had any intention of dropping out – or to put it in his terms, not-winning – their special relationship might well have blossomed. But it was not to be. The first sign that things had gotten rocky came last week, when Trump started loudly questioning Cruz’s eligibility to serve as president, since Cruz was born in Canada. Then, going into Thursday’s debate, perhaps the biggest question on anyone’s mind was whether Cruz would finally revise his policy of Trump appeasement and take him on. Well, the answer is in, and the two men’s love – forged of political convenience – is officially deader than Ben Affleck’s marriage. Ultimately Cruz’s betrayal was born of his instinct for political self-preservation. He went after Trump early – the moment that moderators brought up the question of his eligibility – and he did it much more skillfully and with considerably greater success than anyone else has managed to date. Asked about whether his Canadian birth disqualified him for president, the Harvard-trained lawyer drove home his legal expertise even as he questioned Trump’s motives: back in September, Cruz noted, Trump had his lawyers look at the birther question every which way and nothing came of it. “Since September, the constitution hasn’t changed,” Cruz said. “But the poll numbers have.” Later in the two-and-a-half-hour debate, the dissolution of their accord got even uglier when Cruz, asked to address the meaning of his previous comment that Trump has “New York values”, didn’t back off or even hedge. Cruz instead went for Trump’s throat – the soft vulnerable spot that is Trump’s association with patently liberal, elite New York. “The concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out,” Cruz said, adding to applause from the audience in South Carolina: “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan, I’m just saying.” Cruz’s response was cool-headed, exactly the sort of polished Princeton debate performance he was expected to deliver. And Trump’s counter – that conservative William F Buckley came from New York – wasn’t the strongest. Though he lacks the formal debating prowess of Cruz, Trump’s secondary attack was more adept. Instead of preying upon American’s economic anxieties or their irrational fear of Muslims and Mexicans, Trump invoked the spirit of New Yorkers after 9/11. “The people in New York fought and fought and fought,” he said, recalling how the world “loved New York and loved New Yorkers”. It was a tactic that Cruz, for all his own calculated lines of attack, didn’t seem to have anticipated, and he backed off. And yet, despite the fact that it was quite possibly the weakest-looking Trump’s ever come out of a debate tussle with another candidate thus far, he didn’t miss but a beat before pivoting to patriotism and the place where he does excel like no other: pulling heart-strings and reminding Americans of the things they fear. If Cruz ended the contretemps technically ahead in the abstract realm of argumentation, he was decidedly less so in the realm of the human and intuition. Speaking from the heart doesn’t appear to come naturally to Cruz the way it does to Trump, even if it makes Cruz less susceptible to gaffes played off as bombast. Still, it was the kind of night that Cruz has reportedly been working toward, changing his debate style to be less lofty and more overtly aggressive. And there he succeeded. He may not have landed a definitive victory but he did something else: he answered the question of whether anything could ever stop Trump or even effectively counter his insults. And while Trump’s performance was certainly strong, but we may just have seen the first chink in his armor – thanks to Cruz, and the end of their super sad love story.\n",

      "Lukewarm reception greets Chris Evans's revamped Top Gear Comparisons between Chris Evans’s and Jeremy Clarkson’s Top Gear are not appropriate, programme insiders said in the aftermath of disappointing viewing figures and tepid reviews for Sunday night’s debut of the relaunched show. The BBC2 programme attracted 4.4 million viewers – below the 5 million Evans had hoped for – but sources said that it was unfair to make judgements based on the first episode’s ratings because that did not take into account the impact of the bank holiday and the numbers catching up online. Evans himself insisted the programme was a “hit.” The presenter tweeted: “Top Gear audience grew throughout the hour. FACT. Won its slot. FACT. Still number one on i Player. FACT. These are THE FACTS folks”. The BBC released a supportive statement. Alan Tyler, its acting controller for entertainment commissioning, said that Evans and co-host Matt LeBlanc had “successfully kicked off a whole new era in style”. He added: “We are really looking forward to bringing our audiences even more thrills as the series continues.” Evans told the last week that he would be disappointed if the programme rated below 5 million, although that would be well below Top Gear’s historic viewer numbers. The last series, featuring Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, averaged 6.4 million viewers. The BBC highlighted the fact that it gained viewers during the hour-long broadcast. A spokesperson added that, by Monday afternoon, Top Gear was the most popular show on iPlayer, with about half a million online views after the BBC2 broadcast, while spin-off show Extra Gear, fronted by motoring journalists Rory Reid and Chris Harris, was the second most watched. Reviews for the first episode were mixed, with some praise for its attempt to stick to the previous incarnation’s format but others lambasting it as a poor attempt to imitate Clarkson and co, who are making their own motoring programme with Amazon. There was criticism of the lack of chemistry between Evans and LeBlanc, though the response to racing driver Sabine Schmitz was broadly positive. The Mail was scathing, describing the revamp as “at best like watching a Top Gear tribute band performing one of those unfunny celebrity sketches on Comic Relief ... It was so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQ”. Andrew Billen in the Times was not convinced by the rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: “Chemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie.” His two-star review concluded: “Would we buy a used car show from this man? On this debut, only after some serious tweaking.” One person close to the production said that comparing Evans’ debut on a warm bank holiday to previous series of Top Gear, which normally aired in winter, early spring or autumn, was “comparing oranges and spanners”. The most recent series shown during the summer launched in June 2013, and attracted 5 million viewers for the opening episode. “It will take time as we know, but comparing volume figures for last night is a little bit unfair,” said the person, who asked not to be named. “There’s plenty for Chris and the chaps to build on. It was after all the very first show. It has plenty of room and time to ‎ breathe and develop.” A bright spot for most was the performance of racing driver Sabine Schmitz and Evans’ decision to drop some of Clarkson’s blokeish demeanour. The Mirror said that even Clarkson’s “most sulky fans” should find a lot to like about the show after his departure and the Telegraph welcomed the new team’s conservative approach. Its four-star review said: “Given time to bed in, there’s little doubt that we will warm to the new regime. This time next year, most people – especially those who don’t subscribe to Amazon – will probably have forgotten what all the fuss was about.” There have been numerous reports that Evans and LeBlanc do not get on, but the former Friends star has dismissed the claims as a “big load of bullshit”, adding that he “didn’t anticipate the ruthlessness of the British press”.\n",
      "Saturday Night Live: Trump played as a pawn while Clinton goes all Love, Actually Maybe it’s the promise of a nice long vacation, or maybe it’s having a nice thematic hook to hang their sketches on, but Saturday Night Live tends to excel at its Christmas episodes. Thanks to some over-long football and an inconsistent livestream, my viewing of this week’s SNL wasn’t quite as linear or complete as I would have hoped, but there was clearly plenty of funny in the week’s show. The cold open began with a recap of Donald Trump’s recent cabinet picks, but that was quickly glossed over for a visit from Vladimir Putin (as always, shirtless), who snuck down Trump’s chimney to “state officially” that Trump is Russia’s Manchurian candidate. After gifting the president-elect with a suspicious-looking Elf on the Shelf, John Goodman arrived with an inspired take on Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, who has a literal secret handshake with Putin and a firm plan for expanding oil drilling in Russia. As has become standard in these Trump sketches, Kate McKinnon’s Kellyanne Conway got the best line – she promised not to go too far away because, she acknowledges: “I’m handcuffed to you for all of history.” While the show has, in the past, focused on Trump’s seeming incompetence, here the writers doubled down on the president-elect as a pawn, not even getting to say “live from New York” before Putin and Tillerson beat him to the punch. Casey Affleck’s self-deprecating monologue acknowledged that he seemed an anti-climactic host for this special pre-Christmas episode (and his awful scraggly beard was also smartly acknowledged). With some support from Alec Baldwin and Goodman, he vowed not to sing about Christmas, a welcome relief from the excess of musical monologues the show has been serving up in recent years. My livestream skipped before I could see whether he held fast to his non-singing vow; one can only hope. While singing monologues are often a weak spot on the show, I have long been an evangelist of SNL’s Christmas-themed musical numbers – “Santa’s My Boyfriend”, “Dick in a Box”, and “Twin Bed” remain all-time classics. This year, they delivered again; a pre-tape with Kenan Thompson and musical guest Chance the Rapper resurrected some classic hip-hop for an ode to Barack Obama’s final Christmas as president. Celebrating the “first and maybe last black president”, the duo rapped about birth control and legal weed under the tree, with a guest verse about Leslie Jones’s love/lust for Joe Biden. It was catchy and clever and current, and I’ll have it stuck in my head all week. Weekend Update had a strong turn this week, with Michael Che comparing the meeting of Trump and Kanye West to the baffling mash-up of Scooby-Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters, while Colin Jost theorized that Trump chose Tillerson for secretary of state “because he was three cents cheaper than the Chevron CEO across the street”. And Fred Armisen and Vanessa Bayer resurrected their back-talking best friend characters as childhood buddies of Putin for a delightfully bitchy take on the Russian president. Despite her relatively low profile, SNL seems preoccupied with Hillary Clinton, or at the very least, with looking for excuses for McKinnon to resurrect her brilliant impression. This week featured a spoof of the only scene of Love, Actually that we’ve all seen (the one with the cue cards), wherein Clinton tries to secretly convince an elector to vote for anyone other than Trump when the electoral college votes on Monday. “Tom Hanks,” she urges. “The Rock. A rock.” While it wasn’t perfect – one late sketch featuring a trio of horny elves was equally confusing and unfunny – it was definitely an above-average turn for the series. There were some egregious examples of product placement – Dunkin’ Donuts and Microsoft – but they’re working on fitting them in more seamlessly. Maybe during the break, the show will figure out a longer-term strategy for their Trump impression, since Baldwin would presumably like his Saturday nights back at some point. And given the pace of news this year, the show’s writers will have a lot of catching up to do when they return in mid-January.\n",
      "Watch the reworked video for David Bowie's Life on Mars RCA had decided to release Life on Mars as a single. David called me – if he wanted me to make a video, he’d call me one or two nights before – and said we needed to get another video together. He liked to do them, and so did I – not that there was any budget. I somehow got hold of a completely white studio and that dictated the concept – it was as simple as that. We showed up around noon, because none of us liked to start too early. As a cameraman, I had the guy who had shot the John, I’m Only Dancing video the year before, on stage at the Rainbow theatre. I was second cameraman. David looked amazing in his blue suit – it was made by his mate Freddie Burretti, who made the Ziggy costume. Pierre Laroche, who also worked on the Aladdin Sane cover, did the great makeup. And there we were – we just shot for no more than five hours, and then I had a couple of days to do an edit. We never had time to discuss any concept. And David never asked me to change anything. He was a very positive person to work with, very encouraging – he had the ability to get people to do great things for him. He took direction very well. He was willing to do whatever you wanted him to do. I never found him resistant in any way, and he brought his charisma to the table. If he wanted to work with someone, he would let them get on with it. He would ask: “What do you want me to do, Mick?” And then he would do his thing. It was never like pulling teeth with David, it was like pulling gems. I had an amazing subject and an amazing song – this was the song that had turned me on to David – so what else did I need? David never looked like this at any other time. He never wore that suit again, never had that makeup on again. He never looked more amazing – like a space doll. When his videos got inducted into the Museum of Modern Art in New York, this was the one that everyone stood for – there were no distractions, no dancing girls, just David. At the time it was hardly seen at all, and it gathered some serious moss. In the late 90s, David gave me the copyrights for the four videos I had made for him, because I had never been paid for them – not that I had looked for any money. So when Parlophone contacted me about re-editing it I said: absolutely. I had a little gem and I wanted to polish it into a state where it was absolutely perfect. I had the black and white segments, and when I came across that very last bit after the music stopped, I thought it was a little gift, so I made it into an epilogue. People like the original video, but I think this version takes it to another level. The scenes really add a new flavour for it. I’m really happy with it, and I’m interested to see what the fans make of it. David Bowie Legacy is released 11 November on Parlophone.\n",
      "The Young Offenders review – knockabout Irish crime caper Cork-born teenager Conor MacSweeney (Alex Murphy) and his best friend Jock (Chris Walley) are a classic little-and-large double act, the disparity in their heights made even more comical by the way they sport near-identical tracksuits, close-shaved haircuts and bumfluff moustaches. Bored with their regular routines of working, in Conor’s case, at the fish stall run by his single mother Mairead (Hilary Rose) and, in Jock’s case, stealing bicycles, they decide to embark on an adventure. Hearing that a €7m bale of cocaine has gone missing on the coast of Kerry, they set off on a treasure hunt, pursued by a garda (Dominic MacHale) determined to bring the bike-pilfering Jock to justice. As broad and brassy Irish comedies go (there have been quite a few of them lately), this one is reasonably palatable, striking a workable balance between knockabout slapstick, backchat, and proper storytelling and characterisation. The young leads’ crisp comic timing is another plus, though the whole package is hardly original and a notch less funny than seems to think it is.\n",
      "Robbie Williams: The Heavy Entertainment Show review – cheek, swagger and schmaltz “Light entertainment, but on steroids” is how Robbie Williams conceived his 11th solo album, a record that reunites the singer with writer Guy Chambers, co-author of umpteen smash hits from the Robbie back catalogue, on a new label. Chambers returned for 2013’s Swings Both Ways, but that was all dicky bows and pomade. This is supposed to be a pop event – a sort of Lady Gaga reunites with RedOne situation – in which Williams redeploys the particular combination of cheek, imperiousness and schmaltz that saw him boss the late 90s and early 00s. That’s probably not how Heavy Entertainment will play out, exactly. It’s hard to pinpoint where this album fits in the shifting-sand ecology of contemporary pop. Perhaps wisely, Williams opts out of current sounds such as glacial R&B and big-drop dancefloor digitals, borrowing, magpie-like, from glam rock and 80s funk. If Mixed Signals – all 80s soft rock via 00s synths – sounds like the Killers, that’s because Williams hired them to write it. Strangely enough, he wears this windswept stuff surprisingly well. His old pal Rufus Wainwright helps out on Hotel Crazy, a lyrics-heavy vamp that sounds like it should have a West End musical written around it. Millennial-targeting chart fodder isn’t Williams’s prime concern, anyway. Pretty Woman – a roots gone pop collaboration with Ed Sheeran and producer Benny Blanco – and Sensitive – a forgettable Stuart Price funk-pop bagatelle – are the closest Williams comes to courting the pop crowd. More to the point, the first single from Heavy Entertainment, the oligarch-mocking Party Like a Russian, generated far more commentary than roubles, failing to chart particularly high (No 23). By contrast, 2012’s Candy, Williams’s last reintroductory salvo, topped the singles. Whatever you think of Party Like a Russian – allegedly, it was dreamed up in the aftermath of a Roman Abramovich-funded private gig – few other artists would attempt such camp, bombastic ridiculousness, and today’s charts are, perhaps, all the more anodyne for that absence of chutzpah. You couldn’t imagine too many celebs singing a song called Motherfucker, either, in which the mental ill health of the forebears is visited upon a young son in tabloid-baiting form. “Your uncle sells drugs,” it goes, “Your cousin is a cutter/Your grandma is a fluffer/ Your grandad’s in the gutter…” In its gleeful refusal to provide reassurance to young Charlton Williams, aged two, it is, perhaps, one of the least nausea-inducing songs ever dedicated to a celebrity offspring. The tunes that could only come from Williams make this record entertaining if a little groan-worthy. The could-be-anybody songs just don’t stick in the memory. The album’s introductory title track is, of course, pure Robbie – another operatic, circussy blare full of his particular brand of self-deprecating preening. “I am notorious for making all the crowd sing the chor-i-us,” he smirks. “I just made up that word!” If ever something was needed to reconfirm his pop star status, here it is: you still want to biff him.\n",
      "Why Big Ang from Mob Wives was the most gif-worthy reality star ever To a lot of people, reality television is simply mindless, lowbrow entertainment. For me, it’s a lot more than that. Reality television and pop culture have been passions of mine for years – as a hobby and a job. Unfortunately reality television can sometimes become too real. My name is T Kyle. Who? you might ask. You may have seen my work on the internet before. Just under five years ago, I started a Tumblr called RealityTVGIFs. To most of my audience, the Tumblr is a destination site for reaction gifs. However, my close friends know that RealityTVGIFs is my digital diary. I capture my reactions, opinions and responses to things going on in pop culture and in my personal life. It is a diary expressed via outrageous reality show moments. Weird? Maybe. But amid my daily stresses, it makes me laugh. Mob Wives is a VH1 show that follows Staten Island women connected to men with alleged mob ties. Whether or not you watch it, if you visit my site you know who Big Ang was. The show’s star died of cancer on Thursday aged 55. I was an employee at Viacom when Mob Wives was renewed after its incredibly successful debut season. We would have these town hall events where the bigwigs at the company would present teaser trailers for new, upcoming programming. The second season of Mob Wives was about to premiere, and they played a short cast profile of a new cast member. Her name was Angela “Big Ang” Raiola. “Last night me and my friend were out partying with the guys like we were 21 …” I immediately turned to a co-worker and said, “She is going to be a huge breakout star.” I just knew it. The hoarse voice, the outsized lips, that big laugh. Big Ang rapidly became, as I predicted, an internet sensation. Whether it was rolling her eyes, hollering that she needed a drink or simply announcing, “I don’t give a shit,” in the middle of a scene, Big Ang’s reactions were always hilarious, unexpected and real. This is why she was so “gif-able” and made such great television. Every single thing she did was over-the-top. In a recent episode, the girls gather for a yoga session. The instructor asks the girls to “Om”. Completely over it, Big Ang starts whining in that unique raspy voice “Ommmm I need a bloody maryyy.” I exploded in laughter, and I’ve been quoting the scene to friends ever since it aired. As someone who works in entertainment, the fourth wall gets broken a lot. You’ll find yourself at an event lending an iPhone charger to a Mob Wife, trying to explain what gif means to a Drag Race contestant, or even doing lemon-drop shots with a Real Housewife. I’ve met many reality stars over the years and sometimes they suffer from inflated egos, boosted by their 15 minutes of fame. Big Ang was not one of those reality stars. Contrary to the ruthless one-liners and occasional violence you see on Mob Wives each week, the entire cast is actually a very kind and gracious bunch. Big Ang was one of the kindest and most humble people I’ve ever met. Big Ang and her relatives, her cast mates, her friends; they all made you feel like you were family when you were around them. Her energy, her laugh and her smile were infectious. Every person I know, from her adoring fans to network professionals, have had nothing but positive things to say about her. She was genuinely so kind to every person she worked with. We were her “babies”. On the show, you would often see Big Ang playing the peacemaker and trying to resolve issues among cast members. “We’re only here for a short time, so just have a good time!” This was not a “character” she was playing, it is how she truly was. That was her reality, and we loved her for it. I post about Big Ang a lot on RealityTVGIFs. “You’re obsessed with her!” fans would say. Yes, I am. As a fan she made me smile and as a professional, I wanted everything she did to be successful. She was a great person and she deserved all the success, the “money!” and “diamonds!”, to quote two of her favourite words. It is people like Big Ang who made me enjoy my job, and she will truly be missed.\n",
      "Why Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is a better fashion satire than Zoolander 2 March 2015 saw the splashy beginning of Zoolander 2’s relentless buzz-building campaign as stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson appeared in character at Paris fashion week. It was covered extensively by both film and fashion press, and kicked off an exhaustively well-sustained assault on anyone with an internet connection all the way through to its release in February this year. Given the first film’s cult following and how surprisingly well it stands up to repeat viewings 15 years later, expectations were high for another quotable combination of well-measured silliness and sharp fashion-industry satire. But it was a washout, a tiresome and aggressively unfunny mis-step, the sort of lazy rehash that makes you question whether you even liked the original. Five months later and we have another couple of fictional fashionistas dusted off and resurrected for those blessed with a good memory. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie brings back Patsy and Edina, originally on the BBC in 1992, and catapults them to the big screen following in the footsteps of The Inbetweeners and, most recently, Dad’s Army. The campaign was far more modest, cheap even, and the buzz was notably less feverish, not helped by the film’s first press screening taking place just two days before its release. Yet, against all odds, it works. The comic timing of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley has been curiously underutilised in the years since Ab Fab went off air, and the film, wonderfully short, scrappy and snappy at 91 minutes, gives them free rein to remind us of their skills. It’s imperfect (the plot is almost an afterthought), but it’s far funnier than it should be, given how unnecessary it all seemed on paper. The pleasure of watching the pair drunkenly embarrass themselves across Europe far outweighs watching Stiller and Wilson uncover new levels of idiocy in a glossier transatlantic trip. Both films posit their characters as relics, struggling to keep up with an industry changed irrevocably by social media and populated with those far younger and sharper. But Patsy and Edina were always in this mode, obsessed with remaining current, aware of their sell-by date and failing, miserably, to succeed in the fashion world. Alternately, Derek and Hansel were, bizarrely and comically, at the top of their game in the first film, only to be brought back to earth in the sequel. When your film receives a green light on the basis of fan service, you’d be wise to make sure your most loyal fans are well-served. By changing the dynamic, we lost the joke of seeing two middle-aged, above-average-looking men touted as gorgeous supermodels and instead in the sequel, they ended up playing fortysomething dads failing to comprehend selfie culture. Ab Fab doesn’t deviate from its original setup, it merely exaggerates it, an understandable decision given the increased gap between the leads and the youthful culture they hope to dominate. There’s also a confidence in the characters in Ab Fab thanks to a wealth of material, 39 episodes in fact, that have proved their longevity and also the actors’ skill at playing them. Zoolander 2 proved that Derek and Hansel have less mileage, and despite both films having largely nonsensical and haphazard plots, only Patsy and Edina manage to rise above. The poor box office of Stiller’s sequel was a sign that the fandom wasn’t as strong as Paramount had anticipated. On the same budget of $50m, similarly belated comedy follow-up Anchorman 2 managed to make almost four times that, while Zoolander 2 just about broke even. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie won’t play to huge numbers abroad, but surprisingly strong reviews and a fanbase that’s stuck around since the early 90s might make it a modest domestic success. By never pretending to be in style, Patsy and Edina have remained more fashionable than Derek and Hansel could have ever dreamed of.\n",
      "Live music booking now “You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation”, sang Beyoncé on Formation, as she laid out the signposts for a thousand thinkpieces with a single that referenced Hurricane Katrina, “Jackson 5 nostrils” and keeping a bottle of hot sauce in her handbag. But it was her visual imagery that proved most commanding, from the sight of a slowly sinking police car in her new video, to the Black Panther references of last weekend’s Super Bowl performance. As such, her new stage show is likely where you’ll next see Beyoncé in fully realised form. Tickets are currently available to members of her fanclub, and will go on general release on Tuesday (28 Jun to 9 Jul, tour starts Stadium Of Light, Sunderland) … The lineup for Manchester’s Parklife festival (11 & 12 Jun, Heaton Park) will include Jess Glynne, Stormzy and everyone in between (that being: Wolf Alice, Craig David, the Chemical Brothers, Jamie xx, Ice Cube and Skepta) … Finally, ethereal French singer-songwriter Héloïse Letissier – otherwise known as Christine And The Queens – adds an extra London date to her tour (3 May, Roundhouse, NW1)\n",
      "Sunderland suffer with Virgil van Dijk grabbing Southampton a point Following an unseemly few days for Sunderland off the pitch, it was back to the football and time for the club’s players to provide some on-field respite. They did so up to a point, weathering a literal and metaphorical storm before taking a late lead courtesy of a Jermain Defoe strike shortly after Southampton had been reduced to 10 men. Unable to hang on, they let Virgil van Dijk rescue a point for his side three minutes into added time. This was two points dropped rather than one gained for Sunderland, but at a ground where they suffered the humiliation of losing 8-0 last season, it was revenge of sorts and defeats elsewhere for fellow relegation battlers Newcastle United and Norwich City made it a little sweeter. Or did they? “It was a kick in the teeth,” said Sam Allardyce. “I can’t even begin to tell you how dejected we are and how much more difficult we’ve made our job to stay in the Premier League.” Asked if he could see any positives from the point gained, his answer was emphatic. “No,” he sighed wistfully. “I was looking forward to celebrating my first clean sheet on Mother’s Day, but now I think I’ll be crying into my glass of wine and I hope I don’t take this out on my grandkids.” In an opening half hour memorable mainly for the bitterness of the south coast cold, neither side created much to warm the cockles. After 22 minutes Fabio Borini, in at the expense of Defoe, escaped down the right only for his low, angled drive to be blocked by an excellent covering tackle from Van Djik. Soon after, Southampton ought to have gone ahead, only to be foiled by an excellent Vito Mannone save after Dusan Tadic had reacted quickly to power a Graziano Pellè knockdown goalwards. Just after the half hour, Mannone’s opposite number was called into something resembling urgent action. With a Wahbi Khazri free-kick from wide threatening to drift in to the top left-hand corner, a furiously back-pedalling Fraser Forster did well to palm the goal-bound effort on to his crossbar. In splendid isolation out on the wing, Khazri clasped his head with both hands in sheer frustration. The cold of the first half was augmented by torrential rain early in the second, although the deluge failed to dampen the enthusiasm of a vocal visiting support. As the downpour eased off, Jack Rodwell had them out of their seats but his low effort failed to trouble Forster unduly. Rising to the spirit of tit-for-tat in which much of the game was played, Oriol Romeu promptly sent the ball fizzing inches over from 20-yards. As the game entered its final 20 minutes, Sunderland sat deep on the back foot but it was Southampton’s José Fonte who was forced into an act of desperation. The Portuguese earned a straight red card for grappling Borini as he chased a through ball to the edge of the penalty area. From the subsequent free-kick, Patrick van Aanholt brought a very smart stop from Forster. Enter Defoe. Lamine Koné pounced on a knockdown from Jan Kirchhoff in the penalty area, evaded a tackle and squared for the substitute to prod home from seven yards and prompt scenes of unbridled jubilation in the away end. They were short-lived, however: Southampton huffed and puffed relentlessly before eventually blowing the Sunderland house down when the excellent Van Dijk found himself unmarked on the end of a cross into the Sunderland penalty area and fired home deep in injury time. “It’s strange that we play our best football in the last five or six minutes,” said Ronald Koeman. “From the beginning we need better performances football wise but we showed great character after going 1-0 down and I’m very pleased with that.” Slumped in a chair at his post-match press conference, his opposite number could scarcely have sounded more glum.\n",
      "Lisa Hannigan: At Swim review – come on in, the water's lovely It’s 14 years since Lisa Hannigan first came to attention as the second voice on Damien Rice’s debut, O, and five since her last album, Passenger. She is never in a rush, and her third album benefits enormously from a sense of stillness and serenity. Producer Aaron Dessner (from the National) has framed the Dublin-born singer’s crystal vocals in an understated, often hushed atmosphere. Hannigan’s voice is sometimes unadorned, or with minimal (often just piano) backing; even singing ghostly harmonies with itself. Watery themes predominate, from the lovely, adorational Undertow’s offer to “swim in your current, flow on every word you say” to the disarmingly beautiful Ora’s haunting invitation to join her at “home” in the vast blue waters. Several songs have a deep, troubling power: death and darkness haunt We, the Drowned and Prayer for the Dying, and gentle opener Fall casually suggests: “Hang the rich and spare the young.” These are stunningly pretty songs with quietly powerful undercurrents.\n",
      "Meilyr Jones: ‘Rome is a place of faith and blood and lust’ Meilyr Jones stands on a street corner not far from Pigneto, wearing gold trainers and a long belted overcoat, his face lit up by the day. It has been, he explains, quite an experience: shooting a video for his next single, watching the sun rise, kissing a stranger and riding shotgun on a Vespa around the backroads of Rome. He leads me through the evening streets, warm with early spring, and is seemingly carried by a kind of buoyancy: talking about the sea, poetry, his childhood in Aberystwyth, his flatshare in London, heading down quiet roads, around corners, doubling back, until we find the bar he has been hunting: a narrow corridor where the wine comes served in plastic cups and the stereo plays opera. At the next table a man is giving a guitar lesson while a small boy plays hide and seek beneath the chairs. Rome is where, three years ago, Jones felt his life begin to change. For eight years and three albums he had fronted the band Race Horses. When they split in January 2013, he found himself cut adrift, 26 years old, questioning the direction of his life and his relationship with music. “It was a messy break and I felt that I’d lost friends,” he says. “I felt I’d developed a fear of committing to anything. I didn’t feel at all ready to think of myself as a solo musician. I just felt like being normal.” He began investing his time into other artforms: he was dating a sculptor at the time, and his brother gave him a book on sculpture written by the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. He read Byron and Berlioz’s memoirs and Goethe’s Italian Journey. “All these signs were leading me to Rome,” he recalls. “And I had an intuition that I should go there, that something good and magical might happen if I just looked the other way a little bit and let things happen.” Jones tries to explain the excitement of that time. “I started to feel a new life force,” he says. “It didn’t feel like an academic pursuit, it just felt like how it did when I discovered the Beatles for the first time.” He was weary, he adds, of a world that was “too knowing, and too niche”, of the “cool, affluent-sounding music” that seemed all-pervading. By contrast, he says, “[classical] sculpture and Renaissance music felt like a really living thing. I was enjoying Byron and Don Juan in a really vivid way. It didn’t feel exaggerated or put on – Byron and Keats were what felt real to me. And a love of nature, and my serious feelings of love.” Speaking with Jones is much like this: a tumble of enthusiasms that can encompass Bel Canto and Let’s Wrestle in a single breath. In seemingly one conversational strand he’ll tell you of his love for children’s literature (his father was a children’s book editor), Fellini and the plastic floral arrangements you often find in Italian churches. It’s a quality his album 2013 captures, too: Scottish choirs lie down beside karaoke bars, Japanese buskers, orchestras, bursts of David Bowie’s Rebel Rebel. “That feels like modern life to me,” he says by way of explanation. “You can place the cheap next to the expensive thing and not put the emphasis on the expensive thing. You can like pop culture, and you can like recording with an orchestra, and just let them live together.” Jones always loved music and performance. “I remember coming home from school one day and saying to my mum: ‘I really want to sing in the Eistedfodd,’” he says. “And my mum was really shocked. I started singing duets with this guy who was really tiny, and I was really tall. But I loved it, I absolutely loved it. I just felt like I could do it, and all my feelings could go into singing.” A few years later he began learning the tuba. “And I got quite good at the tuba, I guess,” he says. “I loved it, I loved playing solos on it. I felt I could just close my eyes and swim in the sound. It felt really colourful and sensitive – like singing, where my feelings would just come into musical sound.” The love for the tuba persisted, even after he got madly into the Beatles, learned bass and started a band. And it was his love of the tuba that led him to study at the Royal College of Music, an experience he describes as “making me more excited about rock’n’roll”. He dropped out before graduation. “I thought it would be a really creative place,” he says, “but it was just dull.” He recalls the confusion of that first term, of not understanding how anything worked. “I didn’t come from a music college background, or private school, I was from a comprehensive,” he says. “And it kind of meant they all knew what to do, because they’d been in a younger version of that.” We move on to a cinema bar a few streets away, sit on a sofa and watch the room. Jones spent six weeks living in Rome, though it felt longer. “Time seemed to stretch,” he says. “Nights felt really exciting and wild and free. And in the days I’d go running and go to churches and look at frescoes and lie down in the park and feel really happy. It was kind of a recovering thing. But it did feel like a new life.” He lived in a flatshare he found on Craigslist, staying up until the small hours with his flatmates, trying to follow their conversation though he had no Italian, trying to learn the language through reading Dante. He remembers one evening taking a copy of Tasso’s poetry to a bar, and a group of actors trying to translate it for him “til four or five in the morning”. He fell in love with the city’s looseness, he says. With the fact “you can’t apply a logical light to a place that operates from a place of faith and blood and lust”. He did not think about music. “I thought about other things,” he says. “But then nature just led to tunes starting coming into my head, and I started to write them down.” They did not sound like Race Horses songs. “I didn’t imagine playing them in a band, it was just that music was coming. It felt like a new way of writing music for me – light and balanced and not intense, but beautiful.”What he wanted, he says, was “to speak from a place that felt like it was dying, and that comes from music that was recorded in one room around one microphone, when people were closer, when people didn’t contrive themselves into versions of themselves when recording.” He craved something that was “gentle and dramatic and lovely and sweet, not crude”. I wonder how deliberate his intellectual nods are, how audiences might respond to songs that reference DH Lawrence and Berlioz. “There’s almost been a generation robbed of intelligence,” he says gently. “I think we live in a time where it’s so the wrong balance, where any whiff of it is seen as stuck-up. Everyone’s like: ‘Ooh, Byron, posh, fucking weird.’ And yeah, true, but essentially also really brave and human and easy to read – so easy to read! I can read it! It’s not psychological Russian stuff. It’s beautiful, effortless. And I think my criticism of now is the fact there’s not enough roughness. Things aren’t sexy enough, genuinely sexy. Things aren’t wild enough, things aren’t erotic enough, things aren’t gentle enough, things aren’t light enough, things aren’t fun enough.” In the bar a film club presentation is beginning and we shuffle our way out into the street, to the sound of music and motorbike engines, of busy restaurants and laughter spilling from nearby bars. Jones stops and beckons me down to where a window is all lit up and inside a room full of men and women are dancing the tango, their bodies studies in poise and flex. Jones looks enraptured. “That’s amazing!” he says, half to himself. I think back to something he told me earlier, as we left the bar. “In a way this is an exciting time to live in,” he said. “Because sex has turned into such a casual whatever, and the mind is neglected as well. And both those two things, they’re the best things, and they’re together hidden somewhere.” Just for a moment, looking at Jones’s face pressed up against a window in a backstreet in Rome, I wonder if we might have found them. 2013 is out on Moshi Moshi\n",
      "The Millennial Whoop: the melodic hook that’s taken over pop music It goes by many names, but in today’s pop, it’s always there. Jesse Lacey from the band Brand New calls it the “mom calling you inside from the porch interval”. More recently, it’s become known as the Millennial Whoop, and it’s a standard of big pop songs from Katy Perry to Justin Bieber to Kings Of Leon to will.i.am to Fall Out Boy. Now, the Whoop has become more than a far-off niggle about all modern pop sounding the same, thanks to a recent forensic dissection of the phenomenon by Patrick Metzger on his website, The Patterning. Metzger isolates it as: “A sequence of notes that alternates between the fifth and third notes of a major scale, typically starting on the fifth. The rhythm is usually straight 8th-notes, but it may start on the downbeat or on the upbeat in different songs. A singer usually belts these notes with an “Oh” phoneme, often in a “Wa-oh-wa-oh” pattern. And it’s in so many pop songs it’s criminal.” The cleanest example of what he means came right at the start of the millennial era, with the monolithic hook for the Rasmus’s 2003 hit In the Shadows. The most recent comes from the sainted Frank Ocean’s Ivy, released a week ago. The funniest is a track cut from the Lonely Island’s forthcoming movie Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, satirising the teen-muppet jingles of the Bieber-wave. In between, there have been lawsuits over whether anyone can truly own the Whoop. In 2013, songwriter Ally Burnett tried to sue Carly-Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their collaboration Good Time, which she said plagiarised her own Ah, It’s a Love Song, a case based mainly on the Whoop they shared. Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City held out, and won $500,000 plus legal proof that the Whoop is for everyone. Pop music, as Metzger points out, is always based on a measure of comforting familiarity. We like the Whoop (and songwriters especially like it) because it gives us enough orientation to allow us to get our heads around a piece of music we may not already be familiar with. In the slavishly playlisted, gnat’s-attention-span world of daytime radio, the Whoop has become a signalling device, often cropping up bang on cue around the one-minute mark, saying: “Hey wait! Don’t run away just yet!” Naturally, the Whoop is not the first time pop music has eaten itself – there was the Bo Diddley Beat as far back as the 1950s. Some melodic ideas transcend all cultures. Axis of Awesome’s 4 Chords speared the I-V-vi-IV chord progression that underlies hundreds of hits. And there are never going to be more than 12 notes on the western scale. But given that a 2012 study concluded that the diversity of melodies used over the preceding 55 years had shrunk dramatically, the ubiquitous Whoop’s smothering two-note baby-talk emotional register means that your sense of pop music dumbing down may not be entirely down to ageing.\n",
      "Kendrick Lamar's Untitled Unmastered: 'The work of someone who's in it for the long haul' – first-listen review At first glance, Kendrick Lamar’s fourth album – if Untitled Unmastered is an album, rather than a dumping of offcuts – looks suspiciously like a reaction against his third album. To Pimp a Butterfly was a dense, grandiose statement: equal parts soul-bearing confessional and state of the nation address, complete with a narrative thread and a vast cast that underlined its expansive musical ambitions and sense of place in the pantheon of legendary black music (guest appearances from Ronald Isley, George Clinton and Tupac Shakur, and samples from Sufjan Stevens and Fela Kuti amid the bursts of jazz playing from Kamasi Washington and Robert Glasper). By contrast, its successor is less than half as long, arrives in a plain sleeve with its tracks unnamed, save for a series of mysterious dates that may allude to when the tracks were written or recorded, or the incidents that inspired the lyrics took place, or indeed neither of those things. It appears to suggest it’s unfinished and no credits – a state of affairs that’s enabled producer Swizz Beatz to claim that his five-year-old son produced the penultimate track. In fact, the latter isn’t an entirely ridiculous suggestion: the second half of 2014-2016, as we’re going to have to call it, appears to consist of a rough lo-fi recording – it might be of a rehearsal or a songwriting session, but it sounds like Lamar trying to amuse his mates with the aid of a bass guitar riff, endlessly harping on a pun about oral sex that also turns up in 08/14/2014 – might conceivably have been captured by a child inadvertently pressing record. This gives the impression of an artist keen to deflate the kind of expectations heaped upon him since To Pimp a Butterfly’s release. Lamar finds himself pressured to push artistic boundaries while selling millions of copies and acting as hip-hop’s political conscience, or, as he puts it on Untitled Unmastered’s opening track, “to use my vocals to save mankind for you”. Or perhaps Lamar, who is clearly intelligent and empathetic, has noted that we live in a grim world of instant reactions and first-listen reviews and decided to throw critics a bone, knocking out something straightforward and throwaway that can neatly be summarised after a few cursory spins. Or, as a few cursory spins reveals, perhaps not. In the opening eight minutes alone you get a burst of Isaac Hayes-ish pillow talk (disturbingly directed at someone the protagonist calls “little lamb”), some distinctly free playing on sax and piano, a concentrated burst of brilliantly turned apocalyptic imagery, a scattering of off-key, arrhythmic samples, ruminations on the pressures and pleasures of fame, along with thought about racism, the Catholic church sex abuse scandal and what position Lamar likes to have sex in. You get a gentle musical coda that seems completely unconnected to the track that precedes it, lyrics that switch dizzyingly between narrators and a light sprinkling of the kind of high, wailing synth sounds that decorate Roy Ayers’ Everybody Loves the Sunshine and dozens of g-funk tracks. From dense lyrics, complex and often wilfully uncommercial music, to the influence of jazz, social comment rubbing against personal angst and references to 70s soul, Untitled Unmastered is obviously intent on continuing down the path of To Pimp a Butterfly, for better or for worse. On the plus side, you’re continually struck by a thrilling sense of freewheeling, unfettered musical inventiveness. If you were looking to find fault, you might note that an artist who devotes four minutes of a 34-minute-long album to a rough recording of a loose rehearsal jam is not someone much abashed by accusations of self-indulgence. If it occasionally sounds less bleak and chaotic than its predecessor, less eager to short circuit anything resembling a melodic hook with a deliberately jarring musical shift – 09/21/2014 and 06/30/2014 are beautiful pieces of music, the former woozily gorgeous, with a heavy-lidded female vocal; the latter boasting a guest appearance from CeeLo Green over a Latin rhythm and strings. There are moments when the album is overwhelmed by claustrophobia and paranoia, not least 08/14/2014’s unsettling melange of sparsely accompanied soul vocals, frantic whispering and dark lyrics. 06/30/2014’s sweet thumbs up for misfits, meanwhile, proves to be a solitary sliver of hope. Elsewhere, Lamar’s commercial success is tempered by the belief that the music industry treats black artists like slaves, while his Christianity is undermined by the feeling that organised religion is corrupt, and the problems facing the US are nothing compared to the horrors lurking in the world elsewhere: the album concludes with Lamar being ticked off for moaning by a Cape Town native, who offers the old “tsk, first world problems” response over a slinky piece of synthesised funk, informing him: “Your projects ain’t shit, I grew up in a hut, bitch”. When Lamar performed the track now known as 05/28/2013 on The Colbert Report at the end of 2014, it came complete with a defiant coda not a million miles removed from the chorus of To Pimp a Butterfly’s Alright that was later adopted as chant by Black Lives Matter activists: tellingly, its optimism has vanished from the version here. Quite what Untitled Unmastered is supposed to be is an intriguing point. You could argue that it seems like an addendum to To Pimp a Butterfly, in that initial impressions suggest pretty much anything here could sit comfortably on that album: it doesn’t feel like the radical departure that its predecessor did from 2012’s Good Kid, MADD City. Equally, the fact that pretty much anything on it could sit comfortably on that record tells you something about the quality of what’s here. Cheeringly, it doesn’t sound like music made by someone buckling under the weight of expectations that follow such a vast critical and commercial successs. Instead, it sounds like the work of someone who’s in it for the long haul.\n",
      "New band of the week: Whitney (No 90) Hometown: Chicago. The lineup: Julien Ehrlich (drums, vocals), Max Kakacek (guitar), Ziyad Asrar (keyboards), Will Miller (trumpet). The background: Look what just blew in from the windy city. Whitney, a new band comprising familiar faces: Max Kakacek, guitarist with Smith Westerns, a band once hailed round these parts for their glam influences and “sloppy precision”; and Julien Ehrlich, former drummer with “lo-fi yet luxuriant psych-soul” crew Unknown Mortal Orchestra. There are other musicians involved, including Ziyad Asrar from an outfit called Touching Voids (no, us neither), and apparently Jonathan Rado of Foxygen has had some input. They’ve actually been recording as a six-piece – two guitars, bass, keys, horns and drums – for an album which could be out as early as spring 2016. But it’s mainly Uhrlich and Kakacek’s show. Which means plenty of the former’s sweet soul falsetto and lashings of the latter’s sun-dappled guitar. Not sure where they got the name, but it’s not la Houston or indeed US sitcom star Whitney Cummings. One story has it that it comes from Ehrlich’s first kiss, or even “an old-ass dude living alone” they dreamed up: “Whitney’s not living well,” they imagine. “He’s very sad and distraught, but he has good times, too.” They mainly write about breakups, but there’s one song about Ehrlich’s late grandad. Demos were initially recorded in a Wisconsin cabin, to give them the quality of lost recordings: think Bon Iver, with elements of folk and country, only given a Chicago soul makeover. If Curtis Mayfield fronted a stoner-rock band ... While the music is buoyant, lyrically we’re in bummed-out territory. “The subject matter isn’t happy, but it sounds really happy,” Ehrlich offers, helpfully. No Woman opens with Rhodes keyboards, some sad trumpet and a wistful voice that skirts the perimeters of folk, country and soul. “I’ve been going through a change,” sings Ehrlich in his disarming high register, like Kurt Wagner of Lambchop after being kicked in the cojones, capturing the stunned disquiet of those first moments of readjustment after – to quote the great Chicago bluesmen Hall & Oates – She’s Gone. “It’s about losing the love of your life and being thrown into an aimless journey because of it,” furthers Ehrlich, choking back tears (we made that last bit up for effect – he might have been laughing for all we know). No Matter Where We Go is light, lachrymal boogie: there is a brightness to this rock, a translucence, suggestive of transcendence. The video, tellingly, is very sunshine-y. Orange Juice sort of stumbled on this crushing blend 35 years ago, but that’s OK. Southern Nights is a cover of an old Allen Toussaint tune, and it augurs well for that debut album that it could be a Whitney original. We like the maximal use of “da-da-das” and the way, at one point, the guitar approximates the poignant ping and twang of a koto. Soul-country boogie from Chicago via Japan? Why wouldn’t you want to witness that first-hand? Well, you can, in London, at the Moth Club on 18 February. Dress code: old-ass hermit. The buzz: “The best band you haven’t heard yet.” The truth: Houston, we don’t have a problem. Most likely to: Appeal to 2 broke dudes. Least likely to: Drink orange juice. What to buy: No Woman and No Matter Where We Go are available on Secretly Canadian. File next to: Lambchop, Curtis Mayfield, Orange Juice, Bon Iver. Links: facebook.com/whitneychicago. Ones to watch: J F L E, Let’s Eat Grandma, White Wine, Nisennenmondai, Carrie Rodriguez.\n",
      "Obama talks Trump, Star Wars and Kendrick Lamar in YouTube interview For his annual video chat about the State of the Union address, Barack Obama sat down on Friday with three YouTube vloggers. The breezy, hour-long conversation covered topics including his new gun control measures, perceived police brutality and the rise of Donald Trump. He was also asked who would win a rap battle between Drake and Kendrick Lamar. Obama spoke with sWooZie, Destin Sandlin and Ingrid Nilsen, who each have more than 3.5 million YouTube subscribers. The president said that though he had not yet seen the new Star Wars film, the 1977 original was his favourite of the series. Asked which character he related to most, Obama chose Han Solo. “He’s a little bit of a rebel,” he said. If there was a rap battle between Lamar and Drake, he said, Lamar would be the clear winner. “I think Drake is an outstanding entertainer, but Kendrick. His lyrics! His last album was outstanding, best album of last year,” he said. Obama had already declared Lamar’s How Much a Dollar Cost, from the album To Pimp A Butterfly, the best track of 2015. In the most internet-dividing question since “is this dress blue and black or white and gold?”, Obama answered the “how should a dog wear pants” question by picking the more sane, two-leg-only option. “This is a little too conservative … too much fabric,” said the leader of the free world, in reference to dog pants with four legs. Sandlin, whose YouTube channel SmarterEveryDay often focuses on science, asked what characteristics an element named after Obama, called Obamium, would have. “I would want it to be stable,” the president said. “I would want it to be a catalyst but one that didn’t get too hot or too cold. Hopefully it would be one that is useful to humanity, that we could actually use. And not just some shiny object to look at.” The conversation was not only concerned with jokes aimed at winning over the kids. sWooZie talked about being a young black man who sometimes wears a backwards cap and said he regularly found himself racially profiled by police, citing a recent time when police demanded ID after he pulled over in his car to take a phone call. The president empathised. “I’m a black man who sometimes wears his hat backwards, and there have been times when I was younger when I was stopped for reasons I wasn’t always clear about,” said Obama. However, he disagreed with sWooZie’s claim that police are just “bullies with badges … who are developing a Superman complex” and that killings of black men by police are on the rise. “It’s not that situation has gotten worse, it’s that our awareness is increased,” said the president, referring to his own Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which last May recommended independent investigations into deaths caused by police officers. Asked by sWooZie if Obama was “embarrassed for the American people”, given the popularity of the Republican presidential frontrunner, Obama tried to hose down Donald Trump’s high poll numbers. “This early in the contest, a lot of times you’ll have people who are seen as frontrunners because they are noisy and get a lot of attention,” he said. But the closer an election came, he said, “it’s a little less entertainment”. “This is a little more serious, this person is going to have the nuclear code,” Obama said. Nilsen asked Obama why women’s health products like tampons and pads were taxed in more than 40 states as a “luxury item”, noting that most women do not regard having their period as a luxury. “Michelle would agree with you on that,” Obama said. “I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when taxes were passed. I think it’s pretty sensible for women who live in those states to work towards getting those taxes removed.” Obama also revealed that he carries around a selection of lucky charms and religious trinkets. On Friday his pocket revealed rosary beads from Pope Francis, a lucky poker chip from a biker in Iowa, a little Buddha from a Buddhist monk, a statue of Hindu monkey god Hanuman and a Coptic cross from Ethiopia. “I carry them around all the time,” the president said. “I’m not superstitious, I don’t think I have to have them on me at all times. But it does remind me of all the different people that I’ve met along the way, and how much they’ve invested in me and their stories and what their hopes and dreams are. “If I feel tired or discouraged sometimes, I can reach into my pocket and I say, ‘Yeah, that’s something I can overcome because somebody gave me this privilege to work on these issues that are going to affect them. I’d better get back to work.’”\n",
      "Eleanor Friedberger review – emotionally direct and very human Whether singing alongside her brother in the Fiery Furnaces or as frontwoman of her own band, Eleanor Friedberger has always cut a singular figure, askew to her surroundings. The same is true at the Moth Club: festooned with lametta, the ceiling a sky of gold glitter, the room is more suited to gaudy cabaret turns than this heavy-fringed woman dressed in khaki and denim. There’s an earthy timbre to her voice, too, making her sound like a sepia reminiscence of 1960s Greenwich Village, albeit with 21st-century concerns: Scenes from Bensonhurst, she tells us, is about “being paranoid before Instagram”, while Does Turquoise Work? covers “being paranoid after Instagram”. She doesn’t say much between songs, but she doesn’t need to: the lyrics have a conversational tone, albeit more suggestive of the talking one does to oneself. And because it’s just her on stage with an acoustic guitar and some pedals for the odd wail of psychedelia, that intimacy is even more pronounced. Standing close to the stage feels like sitting in her bedroom, flicking through photo albums; each song assembles shards of memory that are vivid in quotidian detail – the colour of someone’s hair, the cut of someone else’s trousers – yet leave space for the imagination. “I couldn’t get her out of my head,” she sings on When I Knew, “so we ended up mmm mmmm.” There’s a line in Because I Asked You, from her latest album, New View, in which she mentions stage fright, and it’s clear she feels exposed up there – the more so when her fingers tangle over chords. Her last song, Sweetest Girl, clatters to a halt in the middle, and her natural disappointment unexpectedly crystallises what makes Friedberger so appealing: emotionally direct, she comes across very human, and as singular as we all are. At the Harley, Sheffield, 5 February. Box office: 0114-275 2288. Then touring.\n",
      "Listen to Rihanna's Work, featuring Drake: first track from new album Anti When Rihanna recently posted an image of herself listening to Anti, adorned in lavish Dolce & Gabbana leather rhinestone crown/headphone hybrid, intrepid fans attempted to gauge as much as possible from her expression. Did the icy gaze imply that her eighth album would be a provocative trap record in the same vein as BBHMM? Or was it a contemplative acoustic stare, the kind that someone listening to a song similar to the triple-denim dream FourFiveSeconds might give? The rumour is that fans will have to wait until Friday for the full album, but today Rihanna has broken her relative silence with the premiere of Work, a track which features longtime collaborator, reported ex-lover and all-round internet obliterator, Drake. From the four tracks lifted from the record so far, Anti is set to be as diverse as it has been long awaited. The glossy, modernist Work skewers elements of dub and dancehall: her voice is at times Auto-Tuned, and a distant sample of what sounds a little like Grace Jones’s My Jamaican Guy haunts its empty spaces. From Drake’s perspective, Work, co-produced by Boi-1da and PARTYNEXTDOOR, is a straightforward song about facing the labours of work before play, but Rihanna’s vocals sound a little more disappointed and dejected. A typically fated Rihanna love story, basically. Unfortunately for those who care not for paying money for music, the singer’s new track is only available from the paid-for streaming service Tidal, and iTunes at present. Take a listen to a sample below.\n",
      "Choir of Young Believers: Grasque review – rootless, post-everything pop Heady with the thick musk of Escada pour homme, the sophisti-pop groove of Grasque is a post-everything album: post-bedtime, post-genre, post-structure and post-definitely-irony. Jannis Noya Makrigiannis, frontman and principle songwriter of this Copenhagen group, creates soundscapes as indebted to the smoky 1980s melodrama of Careless Whisper as they are illuminated in the laptop glow of chillwave. Admitting himself that his music is “more like trips, or feelings” than traditional songs, the group tune out of the orchestral-pop majesty of previous albums and replace such frivolities with the surreal art-pop favoured by Chairlift: all ambience and sensual serenity. There’s an oddly rootless sound to the record, too: tracks such as Serious Lover and Face Melting could be blasting out from a Tokyo karaoke bar or the chill-out room in a techno club in Ibiza; everything is amenable. Intangible and atmospheric, but not a lot to latch on to.\n",
      "Justin Bieber: Sometimes I say the wrong thing … I'm not a robot Justin Bieber has tried to explain why he walked off stage during a gig in Manchester on 23 October. The star faced a backlash from fans after he asked them to stop screaming during his show at the Manchester Arena and then exited the stage. At the time, the star said: “You can scream as much as you want afterwards, but while I’m singing try and stay quiet.” Now he’s explained his actions. Well, sort of. Posting a message on Twitter that has since been deleted, Bieber wrote: “People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things, some people don’t want to listen. But I simply feel like, if I didn’t use this platform to say how I truly feel, and if I didn’t use this platform to be the man that I know I am, and speak from what’s in my heart, then I’m doing myself injustice, and I’m not doing anybody in this audience any justice.” He continued: “There’s going to be times where I say the wrong thing, because I’m human. But I don’t pretend to be perfect and I hope to god that, you know, I don’t say the right thing all the time, because if that was the case then I’d be a robot, and I’m just, I’m not a robot. There’s times when I get upset … times when I get angry, there’s times when I’m going to be frustrated. But I’m always going to be myself on this stage.” For those who never suspected that Bieber was a robotic being, there was more rambling to come. Talking of the negative reaction to his stage exit, he wrote: “When people try to twist things and say, ‘Justin’s angry at his fans. He doesn’t want his fans to scream’, that’s not at all what I was doing. All I was simply doing was wanting people to listen; to kind of hear me out a little bit. Certain people … certain cities aren’t going to want to hear me out, and you know, sometimes it’s my job to just say, ‘Hey, I’m not going to try to force anything’. I just appreciate you guys tonight, listening to me and understanding, and rocking with me. You guys are truly amazing.” Bieber plays Dublin on 1 and 2 November before his tour heads across Europe.\n",
      "Babymetal: Metal Resistance review – genre mashup breaks all the rules Even given this decade’s ever-accelerating blurring of genres, Babymetal’s signature sound is a bewildering proposition. Their mix of speed metal’s whipsmart riffs and pummelling rhythms with dance dynamics topped with J-pop vocals, courtesy of teenage girls Su-metal, Yuimetal and Moametal, is not one for the purists (the existence of a shadowy svengali figure, Kobametal, doesn’t help on that score). And yet this high-speed collision of apparent opposites works surprisingly well. Their second album is a relentless blur of ideas and rule-breaking, with GJ! and Sis. Anger particularly strong. Wisely, they save their only two missteps for the end: power-ballad No Rain, No Rainbow is wearyingly formulaic, while the one foray into English lyrics on The One unpicks some of their exoticism with its platitudinous observations.\n",
      "Lupita Nyong’o: ‘Art is political in whatever way you slice it’ Lupita Nyong’o is, rumour suggests, a nightmare. Difficult. Cold. Prone to making heavy demands. She also quite famously won an Oscar for her first film straight out of Yale School of Drama, just three years ago. So, you might expect a degree of monstrous entitlement, but the buzz spreading through the London film festival seems exaggerated, even by industry standards. Chatshow clips – Jimmy Kimmel and The Ellen Show, old episodes of Conan O’Brien and Letterman – offer no evidence of brattiness. “I don’t feel a need to be anyone but myself,” she says of her reputation. The actor, who was born in Mexico and brought up in Kenya, is perched like a doll on the edge of a sofa when we meet: buttoned up in a full-sleeved and collared A-line Pucci dress that fans out across the seat, her legs crossed, hands folded on knees. I ask if there is a gulf between the public and private Lupita. She suppresses a small laugh. “I codeshift between my mother and father, let alone the industry and my home life. So, yeah, I think we naturally codeshift and that’s something I can’t deny I do, but the version of me … ” She finishes by waving at herself and tilting her head as if to say, “Yes, this is me” and “No, it’s not a grand act.” Her new film, Disney’s Queen of Katwe, is billed as her first “proper” role since 12 Years a Slave, though Nyong’o has been in a Star Wars film and The Jungle Book along the way. Queen of Katwe is a true story, directed by Mira Nair (Salaam Bombay, Monsoon Wedding, The Namesake) and based on the life of unlikely teenage chess champion Phiona Mutesi, from the Ugandan slums of Kampala. “Mira Nair and I have known each other for a very long time,” says Nyong’o. “I once worked as an intern for her, and our families are friends, but she emailed me to say she had the role written for me and would I please say yes to doing it? Less than 10 pages into reading the script, I sent an email: ‘I must make this film.’” Nyong’o plays Harriet, a widowed mother of five, whose naggy, protective survival instinct has no truck with the do-gooding help – coach Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) – promising to change the lives of Phiona and her family. Harriet’s life is hard but it’s hers, thanks very much. Still, ‘Katwe is a feelgood triumph for the sporting underdog. “It’s an uplifting African story and we could do with more of those.” In the crassest terms, think Cool Runnings meets Slumdog Millionaire, but with a lot of dramatic set pieces over chess boards. Stephen Colbert declared it his “favourite movie of the year so far” and said it made him weep, the New York Times reviewed it as irresistible, and Rolling Stone claimed it “hits you like a shot to the heart”. A harassed matriarch is not an obvious choice for Nyong’o, whose decisions have been deliberate and few, post-Oscars. She narrows her eyes. “The biggest gift or award the Academy has given me is choice. I am in a position where I don’t have to take on roles out of desperation or to help pay my bills.” Nyong’o’s voice hovers between mannered plumminess and international school student. “I can choose the projects I can say something with. It’s not something I take for granted.” It is not, I realise, that Nyong’o is haughty, more that she is atypical of her peers; she isn’t on a charm offensive, just businesslike: articulate and smart, clipped and polite. Does she worry about blowback for not conforming to expectation? Her first role post-Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave, after all, was a play written by a university friend about the Liberian war. “I don’t have that rulebook. So I have no idea. That’s honestly my answer. Art is political in whatever way you slice it,” she says, matter-of-factly. “It’s not something I shy away from. I grew up in a political family so it’s an environment I recognise.” She frequently calls out Hollywood’s tendency to mark her as its proof of doing the race stuff right, but making her the exception and not a norm. This month, for the third time in as many years, she appeared on the front of the US edition of Vogue, which ran the coverline: “I want to create opportunities for people of color.” It’s not the sexiest way to sell a fashion glossy, but Nyong’o is unapologetic. “Films inspire people to feel differently. A lot more can be done. We can be more empathetic when we realise how much more alike we are than how different we are.” Does she feel a burden, as a black actor, to keep talking about the “issues”? “But you see, I don’t like to fight the reality. The reason it is so acute is because of the stage we are at. When we are talking about inclusion in entertainment, it’s because entertainment isn’t inclusive and, until such a time as that becomes the norm, then this work has to be done.” It is almost a betrayal to her generation that Nyong’o never utters a single “like”, “uhm”, abbreviation or hesitation. “I feel an impetus to say something because this is a conversation that very directly affects me, and my career, and my role in the world. But I don’t belabour it.” We, she says grandly, vaguely indicating us both, “need people like Tendo Nagenda [the Disney executive behind Queen of Katwe] in positions of power who see the world in a more prismatic way to make the changes we desire.” The platform on which to speak out is one she won alongside her Academy gong as best supporting actress in 2014. It “stands out as the moment that changed my life,” she says. For better or worse? “Ah. Just change in all ways, it’s the before-and-after moment.” In the six-month run-up to the event, Nyong’o is said to have walked 66 red carpets; the elegant embodiment of style and grace, uniformly written up as fierce and flawless. “It was actually quite scary and discombobulating,” she says slowly, loosening up her shoulders. Her relationship with celebrity felt confusing. “To have lots of men running towards me with cameras, to look back to see what they were running after, and –” she stops to laugh – “it was me? It was very jarring. The one thing that made it all manageable was my intimate relationships because they have been constant. My mother still calls me to ask whether I’ve had my breakfast and that doesn’t change because I won an Oscar.” Nyong’o is now 33. She and her younger brother (who photobombed that Oscar selfie, still the most shared image in history, and whom she called “my best friend” in her acceptance speech) seemed to take it all in their stride: meeting Beyoncé “in the Boom Boom Room”, namechecked by Jay Z on We Made It, dinner with the Obamas, that sort of thing. How differently might she have coped if she had been in her early 20s? She lets out a big sigh and rolls back on the sofa. “Oh, God, I don’t even want to know. I still have friends who tease me about the same things they used to tease me about before. I am eternally grateful for that, this happened at a time when I knew who my day ones were.” Nyong’o comes from a lifetime of privilege, and there has always been public interest in her family back in Kenya. She was born in Mexico because her parents were political exiles; her father is now a senator and secretary general of the Kenyan opposition party Orange Democratic Movement, and her mother worked as an editor and is now managing director of the Africa Cancer Foundation. “My confidence comes from my upbringing,” Nyong’o says. “My parents took time to instil a lot of values – patience, striving for excellence, not to compromise. Playing Harriet definitely taught me to appreciate the role a mother plays – that is a no-joke role. I spent a lot of time apologising to my mother for the unnecessary heartache I put her through.” Such as? She cringes and her voice becomes softer with embarrassment. “I mean, kids are so entitled. So selfish! When you realise motherhood is a part of yourself running amok in the world, and you cannot help but worry your heart … ” She takes a sip of water and swerves from confessing any stories about rebelling. Instead, she talks about her mother’s determination to make her feel beautiful when, during her adolescence, her self-loathing had made her begin “to enjoy the seduction of inadequacy”. It is difficult to imagine now; Nyong’o, who looks as if she could have been sculpted by Rodin and has a lucrative contract as the face of Lancôme, knows her worth. But it echoes her speech about beauty, almost three years ago, at a Black Women in Hollywood luncheon, when she talked about a letter she had received from a girl who was desperate to use skin-lightening cream until Nyong’o “appeared on the world map”. Nyong’o revealed that she prayed daily to God to lighten her skin and would dismiss her mother’s advice that “beauty does not feed you; you can’t eat it”, until the model Alek Wek inadvertently taught her: “Beauty was not a thing I could acquire or consume; it was something that I just had to be.” It is why being ubiquitous – on screen or on magazine covers – matters to her, to help other girls feel validated. “I live in America and I am directly affected by the political situation,” she explains. Has she ever been invited to work with any activist movement? “I don’t imagine I’m not involved in [Black Lives Matter] – I have a younger brother living in America, too, so obviously I’m affected. Obviously, I take these things personally. And I know what’s coming,” she sing-songs and rolls her eyes. “Don’t ask me about Trump.” • Queen of Katwe is released in the UK on 21 October.\n",
      "Tony Barrow obituary As press officer and publicist for the Beatles, Tony Barrow, who has died aged 80, was a key member of the inner circle formed by Brian Epstein to steer the group’s rise to global stardom. Barrow coined the term “Fab Four”, which was swiftly adopted by grateful headline writers, wrote sleeve notes for Beatles records and compered press conferences during the group’s world tours. Barrow was born into a middle-class family in the Merseyside town of Crosby. From an early age, his twin passions were music and journalism. The first record he bought, in 1951, was Winifred Atwell’s Black and White Rag, and he booked traditional jazz and skiffle groups for local dances. At Merchant Taylors’ school he edited an unofficial, hand-duplicated magazine, the Flash. One school report said that his written work was “suavely persuasive but short on facts”, which Barrow later remarked fitted him well for a career in PR. While still a sixth former, he began a record review column in the Liverpool Echo under the pseudonym Disker. Barrow later recalled stuffing his school cap into a pocket as he went to be interviewed by the Echo’s editor. The Disker column continued during Barrow’s studies at Durham University and his two years of national service, during which he ran a closed-circuit radio station at RAF Weeton. After leaving the RAF in 1960, Barrow joined Decca records in London as a staff writer. There, he received a letter from Epstein asking Disker to mention the as yet unknown Beatles in his Echo column. Barrow replied that for him to do so the group would need to have released a record, but offered to help organise an audition with Decca. The audition was unsuccessful, but after George Martin had signed the Beatles to a recording contract with EMI, Epstein offered Barrow the job of press and PR officer at his Nems company. Barrow’s introduction to the Beatles took place in a London pub, where John Lennon bluntly asked: “If you’re not queer or Jewish, why are you working for Brian?” From that unpromising start, Barrow soon formed a rapport with the group, as well as Epstein’s other artists, including Cilla Black and Gerry and the Pacemakers. He evolved a media strategy that recognised the importance of telephone interviews with Britain’s provincial and regional newspapers and took account of the needs of Beatles’ fans by initiating an annual Christmas message from each member of the group, which was sent on flexidisc to all fan club members. When Beatlemania took hold on a worldwide basis, the phlegmatic Barrow was on hand to deal with crises such as Lennon’s unguarded remark to the London Evening Standard journalist Maureen Cleave that the group was more popular than Jesus, which resurfaced on the eve of their tour to the US in August 1966. Barrow arranged a press conference in Chicago at which Lennon apologised for the remark. Barrow also handled the retreat from the Philippines when the Beatles were deemed to have offended the president Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, by failing to attend a reception. After Epstein’s death in 1967 and the Beatles’ decision to form the Apple company the following year, Tony Barrow set up his own PR firm to represent such acts as the Bay City Rollers and the Kinks. He also specialised in publicising European tours by American singers such as Andy Williams and the Jackson Five. In the 1980s, Barrow returned to journalism, and for some years he was editor in chief of publications for the Midem organisation, which holds annual trade fairs in Cannes for the music and television industries. He was the author of several books, notably his highly readable 2006 memoir of the Beatles years, John, Paul, George, Ringo and Me: the Real Beatles Story. Barrow is survived by his wife, Corinne ,and their two sons. • Anthony Frederick James Barrow, publicist and journalist, born 11 May 1936; died 14 May 2016\n",
      "New band of the week: Virgin Suicide (No 93) Hometown: Silkeborg, Denmark. The lineup: Martin Grønne (vocals, guitar), Terkel Røjle (guitar), Kristian Bønløkke (keyboards), Kristian Kyvsgaard (bass), Simon Thoft Jensen (drums). The background: We’re at the by:Larm music conference and festival in Oslo, Norway this week, where a lot of the new acts on offer are cool, sophisticated types in the smouldering vein of Lana Del Rey or FKA twigs, or electronic solo artists, or duos in thrall to Haim and Hot Chip. So we thought we’d choose as a new band of the week a five-piece from Copenhagen who look like Danish scallies, with their normcore bowl cuts and the sort of anoraks football lads wore at the height of Madchester. If you’d have seen them hanging around the Arndale Centre in 1989, you’d have thought: “Ah, there go Factory’s latest singing.” The band – who met at school in the town of Silkeborg, in western Denmark, before they relocated to Copenhagen and formed Virgin Suicide in 2012 – sound quite “baggy”. That is obviously a very Manchester thing, but you can also detect the bright Scouse jangle of Liverpudlian guitar pop all over their self-titled debut album, which was co-produced and mixed in Los Angeles by Sune Rose Wagner of fellow Danes the Raveonettes. There is, as a result, a west coast haze or gauzy shimmer that helps frame these songs about a young man’s “inevitable quest to lose his innocence”, as the band explain. “The album aims to reflect on our lust for love, sex, party, family, death and all the emotional contrasts you go through while finding your identity” – you can’t imagine Northside coming up with that. They’ve supported Glasvegas and the Charlatans live, and cite as influences everyone from David Bowie and Duran Duran (which you can’t hear at all), to the Smiths and Dusty Springfield (which you can). This is keening 1960s pop with some of the kick of 80s indie – Martin Grønne sounds as if he writes his songs wearing sunglasses and a turtleneck – although the production is glossy. The surface dazzle is deceptive: beware the grim portents amid the sunshine. Those descending basslines offer intimations of something wicked this way coming. Remember the band’s name. Self-cancellation is something of a motif – they sing about it on There Is a Glace Over My Eyes – but so is death in general: their 2012 debut single was called Killing Everyone You Know. Grønne’s creamy tones, despite the slightly anguished peal – imagine a boyband Brett Anderson – mean you can appreciate the music for its breezy pleasantness, or you can dig around to discover what lies beneath. What did they say before about their “lust for love, sex, party, family … and death”? Their lust for it? That’s dark. And this is dreampop that might just give you nightmares. Enjoy. The buzz: “Roots in 60s rock with a touch of that slick Brit attitude of 80s janglepop.” The truth: They’re baggy janglers with a pop sheen and a miserablist attitude. Most likely to: Paint a vulgar picture. Least likely to: Dream that somebody loved them. What to buy: Their self-titled debut album is released on 1 April. File next to: the Byrds, the Stone Roses, the Smiths, the House of Love. Links: Soundcloud/VirginSuicideMusic. Ones to watch: Drowners, Stealth, KAStro, Shock Machine, Gaika.\n",
      "Rick Astley review – 80s icon returns unfeasibly intact With his trademark quiff, 1987 chart topper Never Gonna Give You Up and ubiquitous Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production, Rick Astley was one of the most loved and loathed pop phenomenons of the late 80s. Then he jacked it all in after a tearful episode on the M4. In recent years, there has been a short-lived reinvention as a crooner and the subject of an internet meme: rickrolling. Now, he’s back as his old self, with quiff, lugubrious baritone and youthful looks unfeasibly intact. However, the powers that once controlled his career would never have let him get away with such torrential self-deprecation (“Nat King Cole’s version is way better”, he says of When I Fall in Love), nostalgic double entrendres (“12 inch!”) and Peter Kay-type cheeky banter. “Sway, you buggers!” he commands as a middle-aged audience recreate SAW mania, before he dons spectacles and feigns amazement at the sights – including two ladies wearing cardboard cut-out Astley masks. In two hours, the music is all over the place, from copper-bottomed SAW hits to covers medleys to surprisingly good new soul stompers (new single Keep Singing) that give today’s Ricks – Sam Smith et al – a run for their money. We even glimpse Astley in unlikely guise of acoustic guitar-wielding protest singer, railing against corporate power. If things get rather cruise-ship soul revue at times, it’s impossible not to warm to the man from nearby little Newton-le-Willows, fluffed intros, forgotten lyrics (“I’m 50 for God’s sake!”) and all. Beneath the tomfoolery he is touchingly sincere and after a riotously received Never Gonna Give You Up admits, “You made a middle-aged man very, very happy.” A perma-grin never once leaves his face and seems to say, “I’m Rick Astley, for God’s sake, and I’m still singing to you buggers in 2016. Isn’t that a hoot?” Indeed it is. At Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh, on 4 April. Then touring.\n",
      "Cheatahs review – dreamy psych-rock with stadium ambitions With the release of their eponymous 2013 debut, Cheatahs found themselves compared to 90s luminaries Dinosaur Jr and the Boo Radleys and associated with the emergent nu-gaze scene. But last year’s Sunne EP gave the first hints that the quartet might have struck on a new, otherworldly sound and the title track provides a salient start to their 60-minute set. Jangly guitars and hushed vocals – so low in the mix that they turn into a blur – create a disorientating dreaminess that turns urgent on Murasaki, a Japanese-versed song that draws on their literary and global influences. Formed in London but hailing from four nations – Canada, the US, Germany and England – the band unite for the psychedelic wall of sound at the heart of latest album, Mythologies. Bassist Dean Reid and lead guitarist James Wignall share keyboard duties and join with guitarist Nathan Hewitt to provide lush harmonies on Channel View. But although drummer Marc Raue spares little passion as he dives into each driving rhythm, his bandmates remain tightly controlled through each sprawling song. Synchronised head-nodding is as showmanlike as Cheatahs get. When the music’s as clever and majestic as the melodic swirl of Seven Sisters and splintering rock of The Swan, however, there’s no need for much else. Pop gold runs through every melody and even the ragged squeaks and shrieks of guitar that usher in the aggressive, prog-tinged Su-Pra can’t disguise Cheatahs stadium ambitions. They’ve certainly got the talent but they’re not quite ready for bigger stages yet, and a too-long wait for an encore sees a sparser crowd treated to the cascading tides of Signs for Lorelei. It’s “a song about a German mermaid”, Hewitt explains in a rare display of stage patter – but the band depart having left the labels firmly behind.\n",
      "Iceland Airwaves festival day two – the rappers come out in force, but rock steals the day For Iceland, 2016 is the year that rap broke. Noting that one of the themes dominating this year’s Iceland Airwaves festival is Icelandic hip-hop, an article in the Reykjavik Grapevine, amusingly titled Get Rich or Freeze Tryin, lists some of the acts worth looking out for. It has also coined the acronym Nwoihh, for the New Wave of Icelandic Hip-Hop. Day two kicks off with a variety of intriguing new rap acts, starting with Auður, who is said to perform “smudged R&B”. He’s the Icelandic Weeknd, basically, only blond, offering a slight spin on the genre by strumming an electric guitar as he croons sadly about the sorrowful travails of the high life, like Ed Sheeran shambling uninvited into The Party & the After Party. Unfortunately, he doesn’t quite have the charisma to pull off quiet depravity in the way Abel Tesfaye does, and he’s too keen to telegraph his moral dissolution by saying “fuck” every other word over his slow, torturous soul. “I wanna be alone tonight,” he sings, and he probably will be. Lord Pu$$whip keeps things dark and brooding, with his take on eerie, codeine-groggy, grinding hip-hop. Through the stoned fog you can just about make out the phrase “motherfucking króna”, and the success of this music beyond these shores is likely to depend on listeners’ preparedness to accept such parochial twists on rap’s established vernacular. Úlfur Úlfur, starring Arnar and Helgi, are the most highly touted of Iceland’s rappers. They make a smooth virtue out of the consonant-heavy language, helped by some catchy beats and slipping into English only for their between-song crowd interactions (“Make some noise!” etc). For all the buzz around them, there is a lot of chatter as they play: maybe people are wondering aloud what the current plethora of rising rappers says about Iceland today. Raising more questions, and inviting a perfect storm of amazement and ridicule, are Krakk & Spaghetti, two pink-haired female rappers and a laptop operator, who apparently started out by competing in a contest to write and perform the worst song. In a brightly lit skiwear store, the hyperactive pair perform their set of fun-size novelty ditties, one of them wearing red trousers, the other in a purple parka so tacky you’d swear she was subversively trying to reclaim Icelandic white trash or something. In fact, they have a song called Hóra Kapítalismans (Capitalist’s Whore). Then again, they have another entitled Spenfrelsi, which means Nipple Freedom, so it’s anyone’s guess. With their comically fast flow and squeaky cartoon voices, they’re pinky and perky, punky and quirky. “We’re all total buffoons,” they declared recently. “And we want to add more silliness to the Icelandic music scene.” Job done. As well as rap, there are a lot of polished, atmospheric electronic acts with powerful warbling female voices at this year’s Airwaves. Probably too many. It used to be a scarce resource, now there is the opposite problem: how to rise above this morass of accomplished “politetronicists”? Still, the venue down by the sea is rammed for Vök, with their male/female configuration and pleasantly pallid xx/Poliça-style pop. Downstairs in a bar along the same road, Iris gives good bewitching over glitchy post-dubstep beats and goth-tinged melodies; aural dry ice suffused with Icelandic mythos. Over at the Harpa concert hall and conference centre, Iceland’s Bedroom Community record label has been joined by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra for an evening of neo-classical music based on versions of the indie collective’s output. To these untrained ears, it just sounds like a glorious amalgam of Gregorian chants and strings of panoramic, cinematic sweep worthy of a Spielberg movie, all watched over by BC founder members Ben Frost, Nico Muhly and Valgeir Sigurðsson. Good sound, too – hardly surprising given the environs, a four-tiered building that makes the Royal Albert Hall look like CBGBs. Another auspicious venue is Reykjavik’s art museum, where Julia Holter is playing. Here, however, the high ceilings conspire against the generally excellent Holter in terms of acoustics. But her music is also let down by her supposed allies: the double bass and violin work, but the drums are plodding and the saxophone drowns out her light ululations. And her material, seemingly designed to take flight, is frustratingly tethered. Where Holter is experimental, Hannah Lou Clark is a husky alt-rocking throwback, in the nicest possible way: it’s actually something of a relief to hear a musician and a band without any electronics. With a mainly female outfit (save for the token bloke drummer), she plays a set that flits between 80s AOR and the Breeders/Belly/Throwing Muses 90s college-rock axis. The penultimate place I visit tonight is like Heaven – the London club, not the abstract paradise. Here, Belgium-based Congolese rapper Baloji – a tall, charismatic fellow in a wide-brimmed hat that makes him vaguely resemble a wild west preacher – does his thing, fusing ragga and funk. Grinning, pogoing and grabbing his crotch, he puts in a high-energy performance, eliciting some risque dancing from the crowd. After midnight, the Sonics – the godfathers of all that White Stripes-type pseudo-primitive rock action, and the only act name-checked more than once in the classic hipster mantra Losing My Edge by LCD Soundsystem – put on a great garage rock show. Their guitar menace is enhanced by their matching dark suits, white shirts and black ties: they look like the Hives’ cool granddads. Against a backdrop of 50s and 60s cult arcana – Russ Meyer movies, greasers on ton-up motorcycles assailing “the squares” – they play a heady mixture of proto-punk and crude, minimalist R&B that’s so good it makes you realise they deserved that double mention in Losing My Edge. Paul Lester’s trip to Iceland was paid for by Iceland Airwaves.\n",
      "Economics and talent drain contribute to Newcastle and Sunderland’s woes In this least predictable of seasons there have been only two things on which to rely: the ineptitude of Aston Villa and the slightly lesser ineptitude of the north-east. Perhaps Norwich City will end up relegating both Sunderland and Newcastle United, perhaps Swansea City or Crystal Palace will collapse and both will be saved, but at this stage the derby on Sunday feels like a relegation shootout, in terms of its long-term consequences potentially a more significant Tyne-Wear derby even than the 1990 play-off semi. Given the sense of despondency around both clubs it is realistic to fear that, unlike their last relegations, there would be no swift return. The imminence of the new Premier League television deal heightens the apocalyptic mood. There seems something grimly appropriate that this great clash of north-eastern powers should fall on the feast day of St Cuthbert, protector of the region. Behind the anxiety and the anticipation lies the perpetual question of why. Why should an area that has given so much to football from its origins (Charles W Alcock, first secretary of the Football Association, progenitor of the FA Cup and internationals, was born in Sunderland), where 40,000 crowds are the norm despite often dismal football, that has provided more England internationals per head of population than anywhere else, be locked always in a battle for relevance? In 1986-87 Peter Beardsley attended a talk-in at a social club. He was 26 and, in the season after his sparkling performances at the World Cup, his future at Newcastle had been the subject of much discussion. A member of the audience stood up. “Get yourself away, Peter,” he said. “You’re too good for this club.” The rest of the room got to their feet and applauded. On the one hand it’s a scene that speaks of a refreshing realism and generosity. Beardsley was a brilliant player and would leave at the end of that season for Liverpool, where he won two league titles and an FA Cup. But there’s also something devastating about the sense of acceptance of place. Newcastle finished 17th in the top flight that season (which was rather better than Sunderland, who were relegated to the Third Division for the only time in their history), but they also had in their squad the 20-year-old Paul Gascoigne. A year later he would be sold. A year after that Newcastle were relegated. A year after that England reached the World Cup semi-final with a team that included Beardsley, Gascoigne and Chris Waddle, who had been sold in 1985. This was the north-east I grew up with, a land where it never did to hope too much. (There is a paradox to the present situation for Sunderland in that, however miserable the eternal relegation struggles may feel, this spell of nine successive seasons in the top fight is their longest since they were first relegated in 1958.) Opportunities existed to be missed, as Sunderland lost in the Milk Cup final of 1985 and the FA Cup final of 1992. Success wasn’t for the likes of us. We Sunderland fans all knew the history. We could all recite chunks of both the BBC and ITV commentaries of the 1973 Cup final. We even came to resent it a little once the realisation set in that the only reason it meant so much was because for most of the post-war era we had been so crap. Because we also knew about beating Hearts for the first championship of the world in 1895, about nearly winning the Double in 1913 and about Raich Carter’s league- and Cup-winning sides of the mid-30s. But that was then, when Sunderland was a thriving industrial city (between September 1939 and the end of 1944 Sunderland produced 1.5m tons of ships, 27% of the UK’s total output; in 1938 the whole of the US had produced only 201,251 tons). By the 1980s the shipyards had gone, the mines had gone, the jobs had gone; of course the football had gone. Everything had gone. We looked at the rise of clubs such as Luton, Wimbledon and Millwall, at West Ham finishing third, and understood in some vague, nonspecific way that this was some inevitable consequence of Thatcherite economics: that the centre boomed while the periphery dwindled. Thirty years later it seems to be happening again. Money has become ever more important in football. London has more money than anywhere else, draws investment better than anywhere else and so, naturally, clubs from the capital and its surroundings have risen. Tottenham have joined Chelsea and Arsenal at the highest table. West Ham, as they prepare to move into the Olympic Stadium, may not be too far behind. Watford and Crystal Palace have played each other 100 times in the league; this season was the first in which they had met in the top flight. The north-east, meanwhile, struggles. It has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 8.6% and, with an average income of £345 per week, is in the lowest earnings bracket recognised by the Office for National Statistics. Necessarily that has an impact. Looking at median season-ticket prices, for instance, only Stoke charge less than Sunderland. Arsenal make more in match-day revenue in three games than Sunderland do in a season. Sunderland are the sixth most successful side in English league history in terms of titles won, 10th in terms of points won in the top division and last season had the sixth-highest average attendance. Yet they have finished in the top half of the top division only three times in the past half-century. In terms of titles won Newcastle are the eighth-best side in English history and ninth in terms of total points won in the top flight. Their average attendance was the third best in the league last season. In terms of history and support base both are significantly underperforming and, Newcastle’s dalliance with the top four under Kevin Keegan and Bobby Robson aside, they have been for half a century or more. That’s why the economic argument, leading to a general sense of resignation or pessimism, seemed to me compelling. But when the Swedish magazine Offside asked me to look at the reasons for the north-east’s underperformance I found the view within the north-east is rather different. “It’s not that failure is hard-wired into the north-east,” says Michael Martin, the editor of True Faith and a senior member of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust. He cites as examples the success of Durham in cricket (three County Championships and two one-day cups in the past nine years) and basketball’s Newcastle Eagles (seven BBL Championships in the past decade). Which is true, but of course it takes far less money to compete in cricket or basketball than in the Premier League – and even then, Durham, for all the advantages of having a Test ground, have had to be financially cautious, their success rooted in homegrown players. Harry Pearson, author of The Far Corner, a brilliant examination of the spirit of north-eastern football and its in-built nostalgia, points out that when money isn’t the major issue the north-east still excels at football. Six of the past seven winners of the FA Vase – and two of the losing finalists – are from the region. “It’s almost like we accept that as our level, or at least feel more comfortable there,” he says. “I think the failure in the professional game has something to do with that – an innate inferiority complex. There’s always been a feeling that in order to succeed you have to leave.” I left. I’m not even sure I thought about it: it just seemed like what you did after university. Of my eight closest friends from school only one still lives in the north-east. That’s not to say that you cannot succeed in the north-east but the mentality of looking elsewhere is undeniable. Between 1963 and 1987 north-eastern managers won 14 league titles, five FA Cups, five European Cups, three Uefa or Fairs Cups and a Cup-Winners’ Cup. But none of Harry Catterick, Don Revie, Brian Clough, Bob Paisley, Howard Kendall or Bobby Robson won anything with a north-eastern side; Bob Stokoe’s 1973 miracle stands alone (although Newcastle in 1969 won the Fairs Cup under the Doncaster-born Joe Harvey). Why that seam no longer yields the riches it once did is another question but, when it did exist, the advantages were enjoyed elsewhere. The foundations that might have led a club to prosper despite local economics were never laid. David Rose, the deputy chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation and a Sunderland fan, points to Everton as a club of similar stature that seem always to do better. Martin highlights Stoke, Swansea and Southampton as examples of smaller clubs who do better than Newcastle because of more enlightened management. “The two clubs are badly managed in different ways,” says Mark Jensen, the editor of the Newcastle fanzine the Mag. “They’re incompetent but ours has been cynically done.” And they’re right, of course, that Sunderland and Newcastle have suffered from poor recent leadership. Newcastle’s now apparently abandoned policy of signing only players under the age of 26 so they can be sold at a profit has been heavily criticised but Sunderland in the past five years, satisfying the whims of each passing manager and casting desperately against relegation, have signed 67 players. That not only makes it harder for players to feel a visceral connection to the club, it also breaks down the emotional bond between fans and players. “Are there any of them I’d be sorry to see leave?” Rose asks. “Not really, no.” It cannot be denied that both clubs have been hampered by poor leadership, but the fundamental point remains that the tighter the finances are, the better the leadership has to be for the club to prosper. The economics are against them as they have been since the end of the war. For one club, Cuthbert’s Day could mark the beginning of a very bleak period indeed. Failure stalks his domain.\n",
      "Fat White Family: Songs for Our Mothers review – still testing the boundaries of taste Speaking to what’s left of the weekly music press, Fat White Family guitarist Saul Adamczewski offered his sales pitch for the band’s second album. “We’ve really tried to go to the extremes of what’s tasteful,” he offered, “or even good.” This is the kind of hyperbolic remark fame-hungry bands are wont to make in the middle of NME features that breathlessly detail their druggy excesses and establishment-baiting credentials: a jaded observer might suggest that the most surprising thing about it is that the NME still interviews bands, presumably as a sideline to its main business of running advertorial for computer companies and encouraging its readers to buy toiletries. But Adamczewski wasn’t exaggerating. Over the course of its 11 tracks, Songs for Our Mothers variously takes in fascism – there’s a track sung in German called Lebensraum, while the seven minutes of Duce achieves the not inconsiderable feat of being an even more incomprehensible song about Mussolini than the Scott Walker one that featured the erstwhile crooner punching a piece of meat – serial killers, domestic abuse and racist chanting, before concluding with Goodbye Goebbels, a lachrymose country ballad sung from the viewpoint of Hitler, reminiscing “about the good times” with his minister of propaganda shortly before their suicides. This is all presumably intended either as a riposte to the way rock music’s capacity for furore-inducing transgression has become increasingly blunted – it’s perhaps telling that Adamczewski once plied his trade in the Metros, a wan, post-Libertines pop-punk band who dealt in precisely the kind of carefully scripted rebellious posturing that Songs for Our Mothers seems to mock – or as satire on the current climate of censoriousness, in which certain sections of the internet seem to be engaged in an endless search for things to be offended by. In a world in which someone appears to find almost everything, no matter how innocuous, “problematic”, here’s something so wilfully, relentlessly, self-evidently problematic as to boggle even the most libertarian mind. You don’t have to be the kind of person who spends their days forensically examining the lyrics of pop records in order to find something problematic to be horrified by the disgusting line in Satisified, where frontman Lias Saoudi compares a woman fellating him to a starving Auschwitz inmate reduced to “sucking the marrow out of a bone”. Whether it’s one or the other, or indeed both, it’s worth noting that we’ve been here before: Songs for Our Mothers fairly obviously exists in the shadow of Throbbing Gristle, and not merely because they pushed almost every disquieting button pushed here 40 years ago. You can hear echoes of their debut album, Second Annual Report, in the muffled production, and in the way the vocals are frequently distorted with electronic effect and buried within the mix, so the listener has to strain to hear them – as if trying to eavesdrop on something deeply unpleasant. It’s an influence Fat White Family openly acknowledge, just as they’ve previously noted their debt to the Fall and the Country Teasers – the promotional photographs for their single The Whitest Boy on the Beach were an obvious homage to the cover of TG’s 1979 album 20 Jazz Funk Greats – and there’s little doubt the old provocations still pack a punch. Even the critic from the Quietus, a website that staunchly supports Fat White Family, drew the line at Hits Hits Hits’ queasy puns about the violence meted out to Tina Turner by her then-husband Ike. Still, a jaded voice might contend, the big difference is that Throbbing Gristle’s taboo-busting was set to music so strange and groundbreaking that it spawned an entire genre. Songs for Our Mothers sticks closer to a lo-fi rock template – distorted guitars, primitive drum machines invariably set to a crawling tempo, bursts of electronic noise – with mixed results. Sometimes the juxtaposition of music and subject matter works. There’s an infectious, romantic sentimentality about the tune of Goodbye Goebbels that makes the song all the more unsettling, while Satisified sets its grimness to a weirdly effective cocktail of grinding synthesised bass, Casio keyboard drums and twanging guitar line, midway between the riff of Depeche Mode’s Personal Jesus and John Barry’s perky theme tune to Juke Box Jury. Blessed with some of the album’s most innocuous lyrics, The Whitest Boy on the Beach is just fantastic, a sickly sounding take on Giorgio Moroder’s brand of disco. Elsewhere, it feels a bit wanting. Fat White Family have always struggled to capture the power of their live performances in the studio, and there’s a chance that the lumbering din of We Must Learn to Rise and Duce gain potency on stage, but here they sound interminable and tediously flat: an endless racket featuring someone banging on vaguely about a fascist dictator, which is something anyone with even a passing knowledge of extreme music is going to have heard dozens of times before. Worse, there’s something a bit smirky about When Shipman Decides’ waltz beat, oompah brass and pub piano: it sounds like something you might hear in an “edgy” student comedy revue, which is surely not what they were aiming for. The question of what Fat White Family are aiming for is unanswered over Songs for Our Mothers, the confusion compounded further by Tinfoil Deathstar, which, amid all the willful amorality and nihilism, seems to take an oddly moralistic stance about sequestering yourself from the horror of the outside world with drugs. Whatever the album is trying to do – provoke, confront, horrify – it only partially achieves it. Some of it is genuinely shocking, some of it reminds you of that old Onion news story about Marilyn Manson going door-to-door trying to shock people. Some of it is viscerally thrilling, some of it just bores you stiff. Fat White Family clearly think rock music needs a bomb putting under it, and they’ve got a point. Yet Songs for Our Mothers feels like a bomb that only partially detonates.\n",
      "Live music booking now Since emerging three years ago, members of the PC Music collective may have failed to become world-conquering superstar acts in their own right, but their jarring pop is finally reaching a global audience via chart-topping proxies. Sophie has worked with Madonna, Hannah Diamond (pictured) and Charli XCX recently collaborated on a song together, and now Danny L Harle (whose Broken Flowers has had a fair amount of Radio 1 airplay) is working with Call Me Maybe’s Carly Rae Jepsen. PC Music’s Pop Cosmos (Scala, N1, 19 May), their first London event in six months, sees Diamond and Harle – along with AG Cook, Felicita and GFOTY – play nicely together … Fresh from four nights at London’s Forum this week, Wolf Alice continue spreading their credible indie rock by joining Fall Out Boy as support for Biffy Clyro at the band’s Glasgow Summer Session (Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, 27 Aug) … Lastly, Hackney trio Hælos, who deliver a trip-hop sound that is rougher and harsher than the original – will embark on a UK tour in support of their recently released debut album (29 Apr-4 May, tour starts Night & Day Cafe, Manchester).\n",
      "Who should Woody Allen choose to join Miley Cyrus in his new comedy series? Hannah Montana And Her Sisters, anyone? Miley Cyrus last week announced her new acting role with suitable gravitas on Instagram: “Fuck yeah! Stoked to be in Woody Allen’s first series!!!!” The twerking, hammer-licking 23-year-old popstrel will star in the veteran director’s as-yet-untitled 60s-set TV comedy, which starts shooting in March and will air this autumn on streaming service Amazon Prime. We helpfully suggest 10 other unlikely names Allen could cast – and the roles they could play… Justin Bieber Woody’s clearly in the market for former tweenyboppers keen to show they’re all grown up, so the Canadian pop chipmunk should be next on his hit list. Bieber’s got acting experience, courtesy of CSI and Zoolander 2, so could don specs to play a neurotic young Allen archetype, with added six-pack and bulging Calvins. Beliebers would boost ratings, too. Jessica Raine Broadcasting law dictates that any TV period drama must feature the star of Call the Midwife, Wolf Hall, Partners in Crime and Jericho. Compulsory hat-wearing also applies. Danny Dyer Having shot four films in our capital, Allen’s something of a Londonphile. Who’s more quintessentially cockney than the “pwopah nawty” landlord of the Queen Vic? Dyer could be Allen’s no-nonsense East End psychiatrist. “Jog on, Freudians. Get yer feet off my couch, you nuttah.” Serena Williams There’s a tennis scene in Annie Hall and Woody used the sport as the backdrop of Match Point. He’s the ideal man to supervise Serena’s acting debut. As long as they don’t have much screen time together – 4in taller in flats, she’d dwarf him. Milhouse from The Simpsons Already an established TV star and is built in a lab (OK, an animation studio) to play the young Woody. Davina McCall Just so they could call it Crimes & Miss Davinas. Jeremy Clarkson He’s an Amazon Prime colleague of Woody’s these days. The former Top Gear loudmouth could play a villainous millionaire who punches our hero in a hot food-based fracas. Shouldn’t be much of a stretch. Peppa Pig As Allen ages, his ingenues get younger. The cartoon pig has a way with a witty one-liner, would open up merchandise opportunities and is pretty much Mariel Hemingway in porcine form. Cue a romantic montage of Peppa and Woody jumping in muddy puddles. Joseph Fiennes “It don’t matter if you’re black or white…” Joseph Alberic Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes from Salisbury has just been cast as Michael Jackson in a TV drama. If he can play the King of Pop, surely he can play anyone. Mia Farrow That would be surprise casting. It’d be even more jaw-dropping if Farrow played a love interest of roughly Woody’s own age.\n",
      "Renting hell in New York City: how my hoarder landlady ruined my life For five years, I lived on the most beautiful block in the five boroughs of New York City, occupying two full floors of a brownstone on a tree-lined street in downtown Brooklyn. It was the kind of block where the gingko trees turned the evening light gold every October, around the same time families dressed up their stoops with jack-o-lanterns for Halloween. Think the idyllic exterior of the Huxtables’ house from the Cosby Show. Think the hood of Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It – a black creative mecca before the onslaught of gentrification ran every black person out of it. If my street was picture-book worthy, the house itself was not. I lived in a pre-war building and it chilled me to consider that when it was built, my ancestors were chattel slaves. The facade was crumbling, the iron fence was falling apart. When glass had broken on the front parlor windows, my landlady had replaced them with cheap plastic. But the house was near many subway lines, the most cutting-edge arts venues, and the best dining in the greatest city on the face of the Earth. For all of this, I paid just $1,000 a month for some 2,400 square feet across two upper floors – the kind of bargain which is the stuff of New York legend. To get the apartment, I made a two-part devil’s bargain. First, I had to accept that my landlord was a compulsive hoarder who didn’t want to get rid of things that were trash, if not Level 4 biohazards. She held on to everything as if her life depended on it (and psychologically, it did). And second, I would have to take care of her animals when she went out of town a few weeks each summer. She had a mangy mutt named Timmy*, nearly blind with cataracts and six cats (one had a leg missing, and another only had one eye). Honestly, I thought I could manage the situation. And regardless, my apartment was going to be so big and so clean. I’d have nine rooms and two bathrooms all to myself. I could fill it with tasteful second-hand mid-century furniture. I could have a full-sized Christmas tree each winter and I could have a boyfriend and cook with him. I could even put up friends and family in one of the guest rooms (that’s guest rooms, plural). Besides, living upstairs from a hoarder wasn’t so unusual. According to a 2013 article in Scientific American, “Between five million and 14 million people in the US are compulsive hoarders.” Hoarding seems like a logical symptom to appear in a world sick from consumer capitalism, after all. I could deal with it. I was wrong. ••• I had met my landlady through friends of friends from my hometown. She was a white woman who had become a Sai Baba Hindu in the 1970s and had an inappropriate sense of her connection to Indian culture. She was older and looking for a tenant who’d shovel her walk when it snowed and help out here and there. I knew she was kooky, but the first sign that something was seriously wrong didn’t come until I called her when she wasn’t home and her outgoing message breathlessly referred to her blind dog: “Thank you for calling Timmy Enterprises. We are not in right now, please leave a message for Timmy after the beep.” That alone should have tipped me off. She also had pictures of her dog all over her house and referred to him as “my soulmate”. I had thought taking care of her pets would involve walking her dog and feeding her cats when she went out of town. But periodically, she’d call to “avail myself of your mortuary services” (said in a breathless faux Victorian accent that convinced me I was living in the upper quarters of Grey Gardens). The cats often brought “gifts” –dead birds, mice, crows and rats – which I was expected to dispose of. Sometimes, there was a feline carcass to contend with. “I think Muffy* has died,” she said one morning through sobs. I wasn’t quite sure how she could not know if her cat was dead or alive, but it turns out she had thrown a blanket over the poor dying animal. “I was worried she might die during the night, and I can’t bear to look at anything dead!” She then left the room and yelled, “OK, can you see if she’s dead and if so, put her in a bag so we can bury her in the backyard?” When I lifted the blanket, Muffy’s eyes were bulging out of her head and her tongue was sticking out of her mouth like she was being strangled. It was as if the Kitty Grim Reaper had slipped his bony hands around her neck and Muffy, abandoned by her caretaker under a blanket, had left this world screaming, “DEATH, DON’T TAKE ME!” Once my landlady knew her cat was safely out of sight in a bag, she said she wanted to watch Muffy’s burial. Digging into the hard earth, my $1,000-a-month apartment started seeming more expensive than the bargain I thought it was. And I should have started looking for a new place when I hit a flat rock with the shovel and my landlady took it from me, thinking it was slate and saying through tears that she could make a “cheese plate” out of it. ••• Over the years, I noticed that most of my landlady’s few friends stopped visiting her. I also grew increasingly concerned for those animals, who had no choice to live in such squalor. When I tried to bring it up with her, she admitted she hadn’t vacuumed in ages because the vacuum cleaner was broken. But, when she had taken it to a repair shop to get it fixed, the owner “rudely told me to get it out of his shop because it smelled like cat piss!”. Which it did – like her entire house. When Timmy finally died, she changed her outgoing message: “Timmy Enterprises is now closed,” she said in a voice that sounded suicidal. “Our founder and CEO has died. Please leave a message after the beep.” (The blind mutt was soon replaced by a deaf shih tzu named Maple Mandy*.) ••• The day of my landlady’s 70th birthday, I got the phone call that would change my life (and which would have ended my landlady’s if I hadn’t answered). It was from one of her few friends she hadn’t alienated. “Please go downstairs and check on her,” she begged me. “I think she is dying! And she won’t go to the emergency room!” There was no answer when I knocked downstairs so I let myself in. Her apartment was worse than I had ever seen it before. Stepping over animal feces, I followed the sound of moaning to my landlady’s bedroom, where I found her sprawled on a pile of trash, with several mangy cats roaming over her body. She was grasping her abdomen, which was swollen and looked like it was going to burst. In the dim light from a spartan naked bulb, I could actually see roaches and spiders crawling over the mass. My landlady was clearly in pain but didn’t want to go to the ER. She had not been to a doctor or taken any western medicine in 41 years. I suspected she was on the verge of dying and insisted she go. She refused. Our argument grew heated, and I called her friend and described what I was seeing. My landlady became terrified that I would call 911 and that paramedics might see inside her house; it was then that I realized I was one of very few people who had been in her home in a long time. We compromised: a friend agreed to drive us to an urgent care facility. The car ride was traumatic – she moaned like a dying animal, screaming that she would never go to an ER. But when the urgent care physician quickly recognized that she was was within hours of dying, they threw her in an ambulance for the nearest hospital. Having not been to a doctor in four decades, she had no insurance nor medical history to help the medical staff. The doctors quickly diagnosed her with a condition which, if not treated, can kill someone – and she’d already been having symptoms for a day and a half, hoping chanting and herbal tea would fix it. I decided to postpone a surgery I was supposed to have myself to attend to her instead. She was hooked up to a ventilator and had a tube shoved down her throat. Unable to talk, she wrote on a pad that she wanted me to be her healthcare proxy and I accepted. What followed was a terrible meeting with her, a patient advocate, and the hospital attorney to go over her end-of-life and do-not-resuscitate directives. Eventually I tracked down her estranged brother in the midwest, who had no interest in coming to help. So over the course of a week, her friend and I held ice to her forehead and dabbed moisture on her lips to try to keep her mouth from drying out. For days on end, fever racked her body, and infection threatened to kill her. I worried constantly about her and, selfishly, also worried about what was going to happen to me. Long term, she’d left no will and had no heirs, so I could be out on the street. Short term, it was winter, the oil was almost out of the furnace, and I had to figure out how to pay for a new delivery. The hospital’s social worker had begun to assess her case, too. My landlady was facing weeks in the hospital and months of recovery: did she have a caretaker and a safe environment? Her friend and I bluntly told the social worker that the house was a biological hazard. Between the animals, the feces and the bugs, the house would kill her. ••• I took Maple Mandy out for a walk the next day, and when and I bent over to pick up after him I recoiled in horror: his poop was moving, writhing with dozens of pink and white worms. The turd looked like Medusa’s head. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen. I immediately took the dog to a vet, who explained that Maple Mandy needed to be dewormed, that he was probably living in a vermin-infested home, and that there was no point in taking him back to that environment until it had been fumigated. I slapped my credit card down to board him and get him human-priced treatments at the animal hospital – then went to see my landlady at the human hospital. Fortunately, the social worker had just been to visit and had put the fear of God in her. Given her age, the social worker had explained, and given she had no family to care for her, the hospital would have to do a home inspection before she would be released. If it was as bad as it had been described to her, the social worker said, my landlady might be deemed unable to care for herself. Animal Control could remove her pets and she could be placed in a city facility. This news had snapped my landlady into a rare moment of clarity. “I can’t believe I let the house get that bad,” she said. “I knew it was bad, but I can’t believe I didn’t see how bad it really was.” I seized the moment for an intervention. I told her that she was abusing her animals through neglect. That they were filled with worms. That I couldn’t let her go back there. And then she begged me: “I’ll give you the money,” she said. “You’ve got to get the house professionally cleaned, before they inspect it so I can go home.” She gave me a few thousand dollars, told me to call someone in her church to help hire cleaners, and said, “The house has to be clean.” ••• It was a descent into madness, and I am afraid I went a bit mad along the way, too. I went about it, with the help of about a dozen paid professionals who said it was the most disgusting apartment they had ever cleaned. Everyone wore gloves, goggles and masks. Despite all those cats, there was an infestation of mice between the floorboards, along with fleas, roaches, spiders and spider eggs. We started with one of two fumigations. We then took all items that could be salvaged (papers, jewelry, books, utensils, tools) and put them in clear plastic 30 gallon bags so that my landlady could sort them and put them away when she returned. There were about 100 of these bags. Everything cloth had to be sent to an industrial cleaner for washing; much of it had to be run through twice. I personally picked up all the cloth from the floor, and I filled some 30 gallon bags, weighing about 1,500lb in total. But perhaps the most horrid place was the kitchen. There were hundreds of roaches inside the refrigerator. There were moths and mice feces in dry food containers. There were canned goods that were more than 10 years past their expiration dates. Her box of teas (which, I’m afraid, I had been served from) was crawling with bugs. Many of her cooking utensils were caked with rust. She had been cooking meals for the homeless once a month from that kitchen, and I wondered what kinds of rancid food those poor people had been subjected to. Many disgusting items were hidden from sight. If a chair was peed on by a cat, a sheet would be thrown over it. If another cat vomited on that sheet, another sheet would be thrown on top of it. Then another. It wasn’t unusual to find 10, 15 layers of cloth on any given surface. ••• Around this time, the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders was published, and for the first time ever, it included hoarding as a mental illness. It doesn’t take a PhD in psychology to understand that a person who literally wallows in shit doesn’t feel very good about themselves. But consulting my sister Sharron (she had a PhD in psychology) helped me understand exactly why it is delusional and why the DSM believes hoarding behavior has harmful effects. Symptoms of the disorder cause clinically significant distress or impairment. These behaviors can often be quite severe and even threatening. Beyond the mental impact of the disorder, the accumulation of clutter can create a health issue. I would also reluctantly emphasize that hoarding is incredibly social. Untrained to really help her, I had enabled my landlady’s hoarding, and had gone a little crazy in pretending like it wasn’t as bad as it was. ••• The dozen workers worked around the clock. I missed Christmas and New Year’s with my own family trying to get the house in order. But somehow we managed to make the house clean and somewhat orderly. Maple Mandy was able to come home. And when the city checked out the house, it passed inspection. My landlady returned to her dewormed dog and her cats. She had a brand new mattress, bed linens and curtains. Perhaps for the first time in years, she could see her floor, which was shiny with Murphy’s Oil Soap. She thanked me, apologized for the mess she’d put me through, and promised to hire a housekeeper to keep things in order while she recovered. But the honeymoon didn’t last long. She was now expecting me to bring her food several times a day, and refused to hire a nurse. I was nervous that she was further going to consume my life. After a few days, I stepped in something when I came in to bring her food. The cat turds started piling up on the floor again, and I reminded her that she needed to get a house cleaner. When they were still there 24 hours later, I told her that until she picked them up, I wouldn’t be coming back. We really only spoke one more time after that, when she summoned me down a few weeks later to go over a list of missing items. “There were three can openers, I can only find two!” She screamed at me.“Where’s my fourth tennis ball?” I told her to go through all the clear plastic bags, but that the cleaning crew had cleaned everything that could be salvaged and thrown out what couldn’t. “I told you to get the house cleaned!” She yelled at me. “Cleaning does not mean throwing things away!” ••• She never spoke to me again after that. Part of me was relieved. I grew to have a newfound understanding about people in abusive relationships who don’t leave realizing that I – with some education and some money and no children to support – felt paralyzed about even trying to find another home. And then one day, a man rang my doorbell. He was a process server, giving me my eviction papers to put me out on the street. I had 30 days to vacate. I had never been so ashamed and frightened in my life. I hired a lawyer to buy myself a couple more months. I could have probably staved it off for another year or two in court but ultimately I would have lost, and I would have been living above a toxic environment. I was lucky there had never been a fire. I decided to leave – to leave my apartment, and to leave New York City. Nothing but good came to me once I left – spiritually, financially, physically or professionally. I lived for a year with my sister, who had been living with cancer, which turned out to be the bulk of the last year of her life. I applied to six PhD programs and got into all of them. I got a fantastic new writing job (this one, in fact). I eventually moved to Manhattan. I don’t regret my years in that house. I have wonderful memories from my time there – of parties and dinners and love and sex. Two friends’ marriage and family blossomed from a meeting in my kitchen. I left with a full heart ready to be filled by new adventures. But I am glad that, unlike my landlady, I am emotionally well enough to know when to move, when to let go, and to understand that people and relationships are much more valuable than even the most prime New York real estate. * Names have been changed to protect innocent and abused pets.\n",
      "David Holmes: 'It was a modern day Wrecking Crew' At the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Virgil Avenue on the edge of east Hollywood, there stood for several years a bar called Little Temple. On Tuesday evenings here, you might stumble across a jam night named The Rotary Room, where you could find Money Mark performing alongside the legendary upright bassist David Piltch, or Tommy Morgan, the harmonica player on the Beach Boys’ I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times, covering Van Dyke Parks tunes with John Lennon’s drummer Jim Keltner, while a member of the world’s best Led Zeppelin tribute band worked the sound. The Rotary Room was dreamed up by singer-songwriter Jade Vincent and her partner, composer-keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, who together with David Holmes have now launched a new project: Unloved. Anyone curious to know about the musical influences on Unloved’s debut album need only consult the playlists from those Tuesdays at The Rotary Room: a little Shuggie Otis, a touch of Connie Francis, Brigitte Fontaine meets yé-yé, Broadcast and Morricone mingled with Bonnie Beecher’s Come Wander With Me. Certainly it was where Holmes, who had met Ciancia working on a film score in the studio of composer Woody Jackson, began to contemplate the idea of Unloved. “I just invited him down one night,” Ciancia recalls, “and then we asked him to curate it, to pick the pieces for the entire night, and it was intense, because he picked some hard pieces. But all the musicians loved it.” Today Ciancia, 43, and Vincent, 49, are sitting in a London pub playing backgammon and recounting their respective musical histories. Ciancia grew up in Colorado, where he credits the cold winters with forcing him to stay indoors learning piano in the basement. He won a scholarship to music college in Los Angeles, where eventually he met Vincent, a transplant from Phoenix, Arizona, then singing in the city’s jazz clubs and looking for a piano player. He was struck, he says, by the beauty of her voice, by its range and depth and phrasing. Vincent was similarly bowled over by his piano-playing: “Nobody plays like Keefus,” she says. “It’s his instinct. The delivery is like a voice, I can speak to it.” The pair began to write together, horn-heavy, increasingly experimental material, pursued while Ciancia’s career in film and TV scoring began to flourish, working on projects such as True Detective, Nashville and The Hunger Games. Their world seemed to overlap easily with that of Holmes – since his debut release in 1995, This Film’s Crap Let’s Slash the Seats, he has gone on to score films such as Out of Sight, Ocean’s 11 and 12, Hunger and Good Vibrations. In the beginning, the new project was rudderless and nameless, but charged with the trio’s enthusiasm: days spent listening to records turned into time in the studio composing a dozen or so instrumentals. “The style was dark and slow at first,” Ciancia recalls. “Then over time we loosened up, so the last batch we wrote, tracks like I Can Tell You, The Ground and Now Is the Time, are much faster.” The instrumentals were handed to Vincent to work alone on the melody and lyrics. She is a natural storyteller, her songs rich and visual, full of dark anecdotes and intriguing characters, her striking vocal range allowing her to play the full cast. “Before I wrote, David would talk through ideas, almost the way a director would to an actor,” she explains. “We’d just have a conversation, he’d play me something I’d never heard before or show me a film even.” Holmes, Ciancia says, “Steered the ship to where it was going. But I think David is always open to see something happen. There’s no tiptoeing, he’s blunt, and impulsive and of the moment.” Vincent laughs and leans across the backgammon board. “In my opinion,” she says conspiratorially, “they’re both mad geniuses.” It is a couple of weeks later, and Holmes is on the phone from Belfast, playing a track named Screw You, by Ram and Sel, down the line. “I’m gonna … SCREW … YOU …” it scrawls. “Do you know it?” Holmes asks. This track, he says, was the one he chose for the finale of his first night curating The Rotary Room: a gang of female backing singers clustered on stage, lip-curling their way through the chorus accompanied by a selection of impeccably qualified, hand-picked musicians. “It was like a modern day Wrecking Crew,” Holmes says with tangible glee, name-checking the famous LA session musicians of the 60s. “In my own mind I felt that I had seen something through the eyes of Jack Nitzsche.” Transferring this very particular atmosphere to the recording studio was, he feels, essential to Unloved’s success. “If you’re going to make music that has its influence from that period, then the recording really has to be taken very seriously,” he explains. “And we did make a real conscious effort to move away from digital effects as much as possible. Everything was analogue – all the reverbs, all the delays, echo, the console.” Vincent herself has an analogue quality, Holmes feels. “She’s got that swagger,” he says. “There’s people who do that sound, the whole 60s thing, but a lot of people don’t do it right. Jade has it, like Amy Winehouse had it. She’s the real thing.” Ciancia brings another quality: “A lot of times with Keefus it’s about finding a single, specific sound,” Holmes says. “And that’s one thing that we shared in common – we had both been constantly collecting sounds wherever we could find them. He can manipulate a sound like no other. We do a lot of sampling, but it was about transferring that sample into a keyboard sound. Like on Guilty of Love, that groove is sampled from this track called Little Gold Locket, a 60s popcorn song by Darwin. So you were playing a melody or a riff with that sample, so what you were getting was an authenticity, but done in our way.” Holmes’s enthusiasm – a boundless, giddy force – seems to buckle a little when he talks about some of the trappings of modern music: the point in any DJ set where “everyone gets pissed and you have to put on something by Abba” or the “shiny production” of many new records. “There’s something that’s really missing,” he says, “in a lot of music now; everything’s so perfect and overly-compressed and one-dimensional, and you lose that rawness and roughness.” And so, in many ways, Unloved is his attempt to find some of that roughness again, a quest for “authenticity and that feeling that you get when you listen to something”. He sounds lit up, suddenly, delighted by all the possibilities that this new project might offer: “Because I love so much music, and I love it for so many different reasons,” he says. “I just think music has the power to do so many things.” Unloved is released on 4 March on Unloved Records. David Holmes – along with Andrew Weatherall – is one of the guests on the first show in Music’s takeover of Apple’s Beats 1, discussing the best new music (and some old stuff, too). You can hear it on Saturday 5 March at 7pm GMT, with shows following at the same time every Saturday for the rest of the month. All the shows will be available to hear on demand.\n",
      "'This is insane. This is three Brexits': Trump supporters savour special night Just before 3am on Wednesday at the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, Donald Trump made his entrance to his victory party amid chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!”. If they could have heard it in the nearby convention centre where they awaited in vain for Hillary Clinton, it might have sounded like a threat. Just as at his freewheeling rallies, his entrance to the crowded ballroom was heralded by the theme music of Air Force One, a Hollywood action film starring Harrison Ford as the American president. All eyes turned up to the balcony. There stood a tall figure in dark suit with white shirt, red tie and familiar shock of orange hair. But this was no movie. This was the president-elect. Trump – who at 70 will be the oldest person ever to assume the office – clapped and raised a triumphant fist above a blue “Make America Great Again” banner. He was followed by a royal train of grinning family members, political allies and campaign aides, some scarcely able to believe what just happened. Behind them the curtains were illuminated red, white and blue. An improbable, rollicking, at times farcical campaign that had begun with a ride down an escalator at Trump Tower in June last year – in the days when he was dismissed as a clown posing no possible threat to the republic – culminated in an exultant strut down a staircase at a nearby hotel. Trump gave the thumbs up and applauded some more as he walked on to a stage where two red “Make America Great Again” baseball caps were mounted in glass cases like religious relics. He took the podium against a backdrop of 24 US flags plus state flags, with son Barron on his left and running mate Mike Pence on his right, as the crowd chanted “U-S-A! U-S-A!”. After 17 months of bile and braggadocio in which he threatened to jail his opponent, suddenly Trump was Mr Magnanimous: “I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us – it’s about us – on our victory and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.” He added: “We owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division.” It was not quite plagiarism on the scale of future first lady Melania Trump at the Republican national convention, where she copied large parts of a Michelle Obama speech, but it did bear an uncanny resemblance to Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address: “Let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds.” Yet less than an hour earlier, when Clinton’s face flashed up on giant TV screens showing conservative Fox News, the guests at Trump’s victory party had erupted in loud boos, chants of “Lock her up! Lock her up!” and a hearty rendition of “Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye”. For a night, this bland high-ceilinged room in a bland corporate hotel was the centre of the political universe. A business tycoon, reality TV celebrity and architect of one of the most divisive and incendiary campaigns in memory – some compared him to Hitler or Mussolini – had become the most powerful person on the planet, his finger on the nuclear trigger. “First,” he said, “I want to thank my parents who I know are looking down on me right now.” His mother, Mary MacLeod, was from Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, once described by Trump as “serious Scotland”. His father, Fred Trump, the son of a German immigrant, became one of the New York’s biggest developers and landlords. After a formative spell at military academy, Trump went the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and joined the family business, taking control of it in 1971. He has claimed his father gave him a “small loan of a million dollars” to help. The firm expanded into Manhattan, and the Trump name spread internationally, but he suffered his share of business failures, notably when four casinos went bust in Atlantic City. In 2003 his celebrity soared with The Apprentice, in which contestants battled for a shot at a management job within his organisation and he could say with relish, “You’re fired!” His eruption on the political stage was not entirely unexpected. Once a registered Democrat and donor to the party, he entered the 2000 race as a Reform party candidate but did not last. He also led the “birther movement” after repeatedly questioning the birthplace of Barack Obama. He finally conceded this year that the US president was born in Hawaii but offered no apology, fuelling the allegation that he had run a racially charged, white nativist campaign. He also faced a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House. Trump may have been propelled to a shocking, paradigm-shattering victory by blue-collar workers, but the guests at his election-night event were decidedly moneyed. The men were in suits and ties, the women in dresses. They began filtering in after 6pm in somewhat subdued mood; just like Brexit champion Nigel Farage on the eve of that result, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared to lower expectations by complaining of a lack of support from Republican stalwarts. Yet what would follow would be a night of rising hope, of belief spreading around the room like a wildfire, of daring to believe that their man might just pull off the biggest upset in modern political history. TV celebrity Omarosa Manigault, Trump’s director of African American outreach, held court with reporters, insisting that the candidate was supremely confident but that she felt “butterflies”. She mused on the circularity of having worked on The Apprentice at Trump Tower years ago and now being back there watching her mentor become “leader of the free world”. National spokeswoman Katrina Pierson also showed up. “Are you nervous?” someone asked. Pierson replied: “Nothing to be nervous about.” The drinks began to flow. Someone said: “We’re making America great again.” A friend replied: “Trying, trying.” Each time Fox News flashed up a Trump victory in a reliably red state, the guests cheered and waved signs with slogans. Each time it showed Clinton had won a Democratic stronghold, they booed. Then the Republican candidate won Ohio and North Carolina. Suddenly, what had seemed like a pipe dream felt just a little more tangible. Jeff Sado, 58, a property broker and film producer, said: “I’m very excited. It looks good so far. You know what they say: when you win Ohio, you win the presidency. I’ve always liked Trump, and if you look at our country as a corporation, who better to run it than a businessman?” The crowd became thicker and noisier with more “Make America Great Again” caps in evidence. Confidence surged into every corner of the room. And then there was Florida. The crowd erupted in its biggest roar of the night so far and people high-fived. It was game on. Wearing one of those caps, Benjamin Marchi, 38, who owns a home healthcare company, said: “Driving up, we were depressed. We felt this was not going to go our way tonight. We were saying, even though he might lose, he was setting up the party to reach out for voters we haven’t reached since Ronald Reagan. But now it looks like he might win the whole thing.” Marchi made comparison with Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. “This Brexit wave, it reaches across oceans. It really does. Never underestimate ordinary people because eventually they show up and vote.” The excitement also infected Diana Loffredo, 32, an events planner. “It’s crazy,” she said. “This is history in the making right here. I didn’t think so before but now I really do. Amazing. I’m amazed, ecstatic. She was the favourite and now he’s turned the tables.” Her husband, Scott Loffredo, 32, was watching the big screen when Fox News declared Wisconsin for Trump, a stunning surprise. “That’s it!” he exclaimed. “It’s over! This is history!” Asked to characterise his emotions, Loffredo replied: “It’s hard to describe a feeling. I cannot overcome the utter disbelief. It’s sheer shock. I cannot break that shell. This is insane. This is three Brexits.” The sports event atmosphere took on a darker tone. The crowd chanted: “Lock her up! Lock her up!” Every so often the TV feed cut to Clinton’s election party where faces were disconsolate. Trump’s supporters booed and jeered without compassion. Thomas Stewart, a member of Trump’s national security committee, said of the Democrat’s followers: “I think they were a little arrogant, a little unfriendly. There were some Clinton people on the plane today and they were taunting me because I had Trump material in my briefcase. I thought, ‘Guys, you don’t have to be rude.’” As the momentum continued to build, Brian Lynch, 55, general manager of a country club, said: “It’s orgasmic. It’s like Brexit and, by the way, God bless London. People in London got it right. They want their country back; America wants its country back. It’s the same thing.” By now the room was nearly full but there was long wait for further results. Some broke into a chorus or two of “God bless America”. Some, after several hours on their feet, opted to sit on the floor. The atmosphere was becoming increasingly hot and claustrophobic. The TV showed Wall Street stock prices tumbling. Thomas Hilbert, 22, a portfolio analyst from Indianapolis, was watching his fortune diminish in real time. “I’m in biotech and it’s going to be down big tomorrow,” he said. “Everything’s going to be down. It’s definitely a price worth paying because in the long run it’s going up.” People studied their phones for the latest vote counts in Pennsylvania. But tiredness was creeping in. One woman could be heard saying: “At 3am I’m leaving.” But then, finally, came the announcement of a once unthinkable, perhaps unpalatable statement: Donald Trump elected US president. The crowd erupted in unbridled euphoria with high fives all round. Their “champion”, as Pence put it, made his entrance to Air Force One and departed to the sound of another golden oldie from his rallies, the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You Want. The Stones have objected to his use of the track. But now Trump is about to be president of the United States, who is going to stop him?\n",
      "I don’t need to play my vinyl to love it Vinyl sales may be on the up, but according to an ICM poll, almost half of people who bought a vinyl album last month have yet to listen to it. And of people who buy records, the poll found, 41% have a turntable they never use – and 7% don’t even own a record player. So as a buyer of vinyl that I no longer play, I have to ask: what’s in it for us? The romance of owning a physical object? Having to go to a particular place and spend cold hard contactless money to buy it? That’s certainly more rewarding than idly downloading a song while you’re sitting on the loo. Or is it just about hanging a copy of Adele’s latest album, last year’s biggest selling vinyl album, on the wall of your lounge to look cultured? As a DJ and music journalist, I used to own a lot of vinyl. It’s not an exact measurement, but I’m talking two full Ikea Expedits’ worth. After moving in and then out of a fifth-floor flat with no lift, I decided that perhaps it was time to reconsider my situation and weed out some of the lesser-played records in my collection. As it turned out, it would probably be the last time I played a record. This was five years ago. My eye-wateringly expensive record player now sits with it’s two output cables forlornly dangling down the back. On top of it are, among other things, a spare dog collar and a recorder. But that’s not to say that I don’t have a strong emotional connection to the vinyl I have hung on to. I can pretty much remember where each and every record came from. That time I bought the seven inch for Hard to Love, Easy to Lay by Leeds-based band Black Wire in a store called Feeling Groovy in Peoria, Illinois; the occasion I found a mysterious album by a band called Ex-Hole in the street at 1am, only to discover their strange, minimal Belgian new wave would present me with one of my favourite songs, about someone dying of boredom at their own party. Is it a waste of records to keep them and not play them? Is it like those drawers in the National History Museum that are full of bugs, pinned to card, that you can’t even see unless you’re a bug geek? Maybe. But for me each one holds a memory: of a person, a time, a place. Or the smell of the carpet when I found Talking Head’s Naive Melody in 7” at the bottom of the 25p bin in the East Dulwich branch of Sense. When it came to getting rid of some (reader, it was loads) of them, I went over those memories, like a flashback in a film. I can’t say I had the same emotional engagement when I deleted 3,900 MP3s from my computer. So why do I keep buying vinyl, if I never play it any more? I’ll admit that on some level, as with the ownership of many physical things, it’s a status symbol. No one knows that I’m listening to Mariah Carey at the back of the bus – but they do know, because I’ve shared it on Instagram, that I bought the Björk re-issue of Post on pink vinyl not all that long ago. And to my utter shame, it’s still in the plastic. The fact is that I am not the only person who buys but never tries. But it’s certainly no bad thing for the economy - this weekend marks Record Store Day when vinyl will be flying out of independent shops around the land – or for the music industry. At a time when everything is disposable, going out and buying a record is a real commitment. If you don’t ever listen to it, so be it. When I first started DJing, not many places would have a CDJ (compact disc jockey) – so I had to carry my records around with me. Listening to them I’d think about the meditative quality of that warm, dusty crackle of vinyl. It made me feel safe and loved. I can’t get rid of all my vinyl, they’re old friends. But I should probably do the right thing, plug my record player in and show them some love back.\n",
      "Wild Beasts: Boy King review – wilder and beastlier Around the time of their first album, 2008’s Limbo, Panto, Wild Beasts were neither wild nor beasts. Taking their name from fauvism, the early 20th-century art movement, this operatic indie foursome were a repository of erudite, swooping art rock. The red-blooded falsetto of Hayden Thorpe used to crack ecstatically, so deeply felt were their songs. The rest of the band shirked the obvious, energetically. It’s hard for complexity to survive in the brutal dystopia that is modern music commerce. Five albums in – solidly good ones, never truly earth-moving ones – you get a sense that this Cumbria-via-Leeds band have decided to throw erudition to the wind and finally embrace knuckle-dragging rock piggery. This, in exchange for some of the kudos, cheddar and ancillary benefits that their labelmates Arctic Monkeys have long enjoyed. So Boy King is actually all about being wild – a song called Big Cat opens the record – and sex, hyper-masculinity (Adonis and Colossus are referenced) and getting one’s “bang”. Basslines swagger, and the prettiness that lit up the band’s first three albums (one of them Mercury-nominated) has become a guttering, neon strip, one that deepens the electronic flirtation Wild Beasts began on their last album, Present Tense. To this end, producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant) mans the board, running Wild Beasts’ guitars through alchemising effects. This approach hits its apex on He the Colossus, when Thorpe sings “Everything just dies in these hands”, and Tom Fleming’s guitar answers him beautifully, all distorted. Congleton also brings a widescreen, pared-back, Texan feel to the band’s previously twitchy default mode. On songs like Get My Bang, you can’t help but think of Arctic Monkeys. It’s not actually about sex, but about the orgy of consumerism that western society indulges in, where tearing cut-price TVs out of other people’s hands on Black Friday is the only thrill left. “We’re going darker ages/ I wanna feel outrageous,” pout the backing vocals. Big Cat, meanwhile, sounds like a malevolently slinky Muse song, keen to drive the chorus into your skull. The closing guitar line is downright poetic in its succinctness. Is this Wild Beasts’ masterpiece, then, where they finally live up to an over-literal reading of their name? Not quite. Too many songs sound like generic electronic rock. But a masterful mid-album run – the intriguing, three-legged sulk of 2BU into He the Colossus into the pitch-shifted bomp’n’thwack of Ponytail – is as arresting and fresh as they wanted the rest of this album to be.\n",
      "Reality show singer breaks China's Cultural Revolution taboo Nearly half a century after his father plunged to his death from the roof of a Beijing university, Yang Le stepped out on to the stage to tell millions of Chinese television viewers how Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution had torn his family apart. “When I was young we were a family of six … My father was handsome, mum was young and beautiful,” sang the silver-haired contestant on China Star, the country’s answer to the X-Factor. “After the Cultural Revolution only five of us were left.” When his lament-filled, taboo-breaking performance ended, Yang bit his lower lip. Applause rippled through the theatre; the judges leapt to their feet; tears streamed down cheeks. “I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get through the song,” the 60-year-old musician recalled in a tearful interview. “I had to force myself to relax because it wasn’t only me who went through this. Millions of other families went through this in China.” May marks 50 years since China was convulsed by Mao Zedong’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a bewildering and bloody attempt by the leader to reshape and reassert control over the Communist party he had helped found in 1921 by mobilising the nation’s youth. A new book on the period by Dutch historian Frank Dikötter reveals the grotesque catalogue of violence inflicted upon alleged “class enemies” and intellectuals as teenage Red Guards fanned out across urban China with orders to “sweep away monsters and demons”. Victims were beaten, flogged, stoned and scolded by “Mao’s Little Generals” or forced to swallow nails and excrement as jeering crowds looked on. Homes and places of worship were ransacked, pillaged and burned. One teacher killed himself after being set upon by students who forced him to drink ink. Another was doused in petrol and set alight. Others were electrocuted or even buried alive. “[It was] a demented environment, an Alice-in-Wonderland world, governed only by its mad logic,” Percy Cradock, then a senior British diplomat in Beijing, recalls in his memoirs. “The country was in the grip of a nightmare.” Among the estimated two million people who lost their lives over the coming decade was Yang Le’s father, Wang Yuguo, a lecturer in industrial economy at Beijing’s prestigious Renmin University. “My father was persecuted and he killed himself. He jumped from the roof of a building,” the singer said. “At Renmin University you heard of professors killing themselves every day. It was horrible. I would hear someone crying and we would wonder who was crying and whose family was suffering those bad things.” The premature death of Yang’s father devastated his family. His mother was forced to sell her dead husband’s belongings – and even her own blood – to feed the couple’s four children. Yang’s three siblings were packed off to the countryside for “re-education” as part of an attempt to rein in Mao’s marauding Red Guards. Finally, Yang’s mother remarried and moved south to Jiangxi province. “She felt sad,” he said. “But she had no choice.” China’s Communist party leaders have officially classified the Cultural Revolution as a mistake. A 1981 resolution noted that the decade-long upheaval “was responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses by the party, the state and the people since the founding of the People’s Republic” in 1949. Two years earlier the People’s Liberation Army marshall Ye Jianying labelled the period “an appalling catastrophe suffered by all our people”. Yet half a century after the mayhem began the subject remains largely a taboo within China. School textbooks skirt around the period and discussion of Mao’s central role in the disaster is shunned. Yang, a classically trained flautist who fled China in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and went on to study at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, said few songs had examined the heartbreak caused by the Cultural Revolution. The government’s refusal to revisit that era means much about what unfolded in the 10 years between the Cultural Revolution’s start in May 1966 and Mao’s death in 1976 remains hazy. For example, the exact circumstances surrounding the death of Yang’s father are still shrouded in mystery. The singer said he believed his father had been interrogated and beaten before he was found dead on 4 December 1968 at the age of 39. “I heard they used shoes to beat my father in the face. He felt humiliated. He couldn’t stand it,” Yang said. But before his corpse was cremated, Yang’s mother spotted an indentation in her dead husband’s skull, leading her to suspect he had been set upon by Red Guards and then pushed to his death. “If somebody jumps from a building you would expect to see a problem with their neck, an internal problem, not the kind of trauma that you can see,” he said. The 50th anniversary of the Cultural Revolution is unlikely to shine fresh light on such cases. Dikötter predicted that China’s leaders would seek to remember the occasion with total silence. “[Chinese people] have been told again and again and again: you had better forget. Let’s just get on with it,” the historian said. “The team in charge is very well aware that there is a danger to its legitimacy and its credibility [in discussing past mistakes]. And it knows very well that history is one of the pillars of its own legitimacy and it will not have it undermined. It is as simple as that.” The party’s determination to bury the horrors of the Cultural Revolution made Yang Le’s prime-time television performance, in November last year, even more unusual. The singer said he had feared the show’s producers might attempt to censor the lyrics but had lobbied against that with the help of Cui Jian, a friend and well-known Chinese rock star. The channel relented. “There are movies and novels that tell stories from that time so why can we not sing this kind of song?” Yang said. Dikötter said Beijing had been largely successful in “stamping out the memory of the Cultural Revolution” and staving off calls for any significant probe into one of the darkest chapters in Chinese history. “I think that does leave scars. That does leave a society that is very traumatised by who did what to whom without any sense of redress or justice,” he said. But the outpouring of emotion triggered by Yang’s performance suggests many have not forgotten the hurt and suffering inflicted on their families. Yang, who cites Gustav Mahler and Serge Gainsbourg among his influences, said he saw music not simply as entertainment but as a way of inspiring listeners to confront painful truths. He attributed the tears shed over his performance to the profound emotional burden those who witnessed the excesses of the Cultural Revolution still carried with them. “Recalling that time in history is something that is extremely heavy for our generation.” “It was a catastrophe,” he said. “It was like a war.” Additional reporting by Christy Yao\n",
      "Jamie Lidell: Building a Beginning review – swoonworthy soul-pop As you listen to Jamie Lidell’s hopelessly romantic new soul-pop LP, petals fall from the sky, squirrels flirt, and sparrows follow you around with a heart-strewn banner in their beaks. Lidell wrote the lyrics with his wife, and they’re full of earnest declarations of how valuable their bond is. Perhaps they’d make nauseating dinner party guests, but the songwriting is so comfortably strong and the production so toasty that you’re soon swooning along with them.  How Did I Live Before Your Love is perfection, like Charles Wright doing lover’s rock; Motionless is wonderfully overwrought gospel; Believe in Me is Van Morrison trying on an OVO ballad. Throughout, Lidell’s voice remains one of the most underrated sounds in pop: sexy and breathy, but with an appealing top note of adenoidal nerdiness. He can even make a song called I Live to Make You Smile sound relaxed, rather than a misjudged attempt at soothing a marital tiff.\n",
      "Tom Chaplin: The Wave review – tender songs from former Keane frontman The first solo album by Keane singer Tom Chaplin has a clean-cut MOR sheen. It is aglow with mid-paced piano-led ballads with crowd-pleasing choruses. There’s also a strong streak of melancholy. Opening track Still Waiting paints a scene of death and destruction: “Buried in the rubble, there’s a boy in trouble.” The song could be about Aleppo, but Chaplin doesn’t say. He’s unspecific, too, in more introspective songs such as Hardened Heart, in which he says he “drove to the point of madness just to feel something real” – which could be about his well-publicised struggles with addiction. Or not. Of course, lyrics with a broad sweep, that you can interpret any way you like, helped Keane sell millions of albums and touch stadium audiences, and The Wave’s hooks and polish won’t harm its chances of doing the same. It’s not a sonically adventurous album, but Chaplin’s voice on tender songs such as the title track is as affecting as ever.\n",
      "Morrissey and Mexico fit together like hand in glove. Is that really so strange? Of all the incongruous links between music and peoples, one of the strangest appears to be that between Steven Patrick Morrissey, the former lead singer of the Smiths, and Mexicans. Specifically, Mexicans in southern California. Notably, he’s not popular south of the border. Of all the potential singers you’d imagine a culture steeped in masculinity and machismo could choose, why would they embrace this son of northern England? The question has reared its head again after the release of the Spanish-language Morrissey cover band Mexrrissey’s first album, No Manchester. But it’s actually not that mysterious. Morrissey’s melancholic ballads provide the best starting point. The sense of estrangement and longing that exists in all his songs is also something that’s present in traditional northern Mexican music genres such as rancheras. Drawing on rural traditional folk music, it began as a symbol of national consciousness at the beginning of the 20th century. Traditionally, rancheras are about love, nature or patriotism. We don’t normally associate patriotism with Morrissey or his songs, but the nature of love? Absolutely. The longing for love? Most definitely. Morrissey’s most famous lament of unrequited love, There Is a Light That Never Goes Out, resembles so many Mexican torch songs – for example Mi Destino Fue Quererte, written by Felipe Valdés Leal. Not just in theme, but almost thought for thought. And yet the association between Mexican folk music and Morrissey is just the beginning. The real linkages lie with Mexican-Americans; with Chicanos. Although I’ve never been further south than Monterrey, my family has myriad tales of living in a golden Mexico during the 1940s and 1950s. Those stories helped foster a deep-seated melancholy within me about where I truly belong. Not quite American; not wholly Latino, living in all the spaces in between. Growing up in rural Ohio, these duelling identities caused me an incredible amount of angst, as I tried to traverse the space between home and school. It’s easy to see where so many of Morrissey’s songs that deal with identity crisis, with a sense of alienation, of being an “other”, would appeal to people such as me. Feeling ostracised, not part of a homogeneous American culture – that’s enough to make anyone morose and woebegone. Small wonder that Morrissey’s lyrics, shot through with dolefulness, speak to so many of us. Over the past two decades, though, Morrissey has made that linkage explicit, both in song and sign. There was his 1999 ¡Oye, Estéban! tour. At a concert at UC Irvine’s Bren Events Center, the singer lamented: “I wish I was born Mexican, but it’s too late for that now.” That’s the most famous recognition of the love his Latino fans bear for him, but there have been other, more subtle signs - wearing the football jersey of Chivas de Guadalajara, the 11-time Mexican champions who only have Mexicans on their roster, for example. Or rocking shirts adorned with Mexico’s patroness, the Virgin of Guadalajara. And then there’s Mexico, one of Morrissey’s newer songs. It could double as an anthem of Chicano love for the homeland: “In Mexico I went for a walk to inhale the tranquil cool lover’s air But I could taste a trace Of American chemical waste. And the small voice said, ‘What can we do?’ I lay on the grass And I cried my heart out for want of my love.” And for those of us who’ve never been, who rely on the tales of our relatives, there’s the condemnation of white privilege in that same song: “It seems if you’re rich and you’re white you think you’re so right I just don’t see why this should be so.” All of that combines to make Morrissey a magnetic figure to Latinos like me. Here’s a guy who really gets it. How can we resist that? His songs offer the chance to escape our bleak surroundings, transcend our existence, and leave behind the limits of our lives. Especially at a time when the presumptive nominee of one of America’s two major parties condemns my fellow Latinos as criminals and threatens to build a wall severing one America from the other.\n",
      "Best albums of 2016: No 6 Hopelessness by Anohni As album titles go, you’d be hard pressed to find one more appropriate for 2016 than Hopelessness. It was a statement of despair – angry and unwavering, bold and unmistakably bleak, furious at the world. You’d also be hard pressed to find an album this year as fearlessly political – or at least one with a danceable song about execution. The artist formerly known as Antony and the Johnsons made her name with nimble piano torch songs, but for her first album as Anohni, she emerged as a velvet-voiced harbinger of doom, her anguish at drone warfare, climate change, Guantánamo Bay, the Obama administration and humanity at large set to an exuberant electronic soundtrack. If that suggested an uneasy listen, then that was the point. At times Hopelessness could shake you to the core: the lyrics of Crisis, for example, were more brutal than a news report and the song had an emphatic crescendo of static and strings that made your ribcage want to burst. But the album succeeded in bringing such difficult subjects into the dance arena: it could be escapist as well as subversive. Anohni has said the album was inspired by late-80s club music, when people danced away their rage during the peak of the Aids crisis. Hopelessness, for all its tales of burning landscapes and beheadings, had engulfing head-nodding rhythms and shades of R&B, hip-hop and gospel. At times, Anohni sounded like a diva-house star on the apocalypse’s podium. Hopelessness has been hailed as a modern protest album, full of environmental bangers and cinematic crisis reports – some such as Drone Bomb Me sung from the perspective of a civilian, inviting a drone bomb strike like a lost lover. But it was also an achievement for the simple yet staggeringly beautiful combination of vocals and visceral instrumentals. Its songs are among the best work that co-producers Ross Birchard (AKA Hudson Mohawke) and Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) have made yet, and their Disneyfied hellscapes of crystal synth and majestic horns were luminous paired with Anohni’s breathtaking voice. 4 Degrees, in particular, had a sweeping grandeur that suggested a camera crew panning over melting ice caps from the air as Anohni, inhabiting a Mother Earth scorned, called for the animals to burn. Complex, rich and formidable, Anohni’s masterwork proved that political music in 2016 need not be hackneyed and earnest. Instead it could be galvanising and confrontational. Just imagine what she has in store for Trump. More of the best albums of 2016\n",
      "Imagining Ireland review – remembering in song the rebels with a cause This concert presented an intriguing challenge. It was staged on the 100th anniversary of the day on which the Easter Rising in Dublin neared its end. And the president of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was in the audience. So what were the appropriate songs? Of course, there had to be rebel ballads commemorating the bloody 1916 uprising in Dublin against British rule. But these were cleverly intercut with songs examining the links between Ireland and Britain over the past century. There were stories about Irish workers in Britain, but also reminders of the crucial role that the descendants of Irish immigrants played in transforming British pop. Host John Kelly’s list started with the Beatles, and included Elvis Costello and Morrissey. Dexys singer Kevin Rowland, gave one of the most powerful performances of the night. The band’s new album, Let the Record Show Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul, explores Rowland’s Irish links and includes songs perfect for this occasion. Joined by his bandmate Sean Read, Rowland started with Curragh of Kildare, treating this traditional song of parting with respect but also an unexpected, edgy emotion. He followed with an affecting song from the 80s about his roots, My National Pride, and returned later for a treatment of Carrickfergus that compared well with Van Morrison’s version as a display of rousing celtic soul. He was joined on stage by Cáit O’Riordan, the former Pogues bass player, who provided a suitably stomping treatment of Dark Streets of London, “which was born in the squats of King’s Cross, not for nice people sitting down”. Here, she was backed by the classy house band led by multi-instrumentalist Kate St John and including Neill and Callum MacColl, who paid tribute to their father Ewan MacColl with a rousing Tunnel Tigers, his song about Irish workers building the Blackwall Tunnel. There were constant surprises. English folk hero Martin Carthy provided an impressive if unlikely treatment of Nothing Rhymed by the “cruelly disregarded” Gilbert O’Sullivan, and then dramatically switched direction with The Row in the Town, a rebel song about 1916. Irish folk hero Andy Irvine performed another rebel song commemorating James Connolly, who was executed by the British despite being gravely injured in the Easter Rising fighting. Then there were angry songs from another great veteran, Paul Brady, and a new lament, England Has My Man, from the impressive young Irish singer Lisa O’Neill. Mixed in were instrumental passages from classical pianist Barry Douglas and the remarkable violin and guitar duo, Martin Hayes and Dennis Cahill, whose playing is crucial to the international success of the Gloaming. The evening ended with Dominic Behan’s stomping story of Irish construction workers, McAlpine’s Fusiliers, and a return to Easter 1916 with the emotional Foggy Dew, finely sung by O’Neill.\n",
      "Pop art, fanzines and Channel 4 – the making of Saint Etienne's Foxbase Alpha If we’re using DIY as a starting point for the story of Foxbase Alpha, when did you first become aware of DIY culture in pop? Was it through music fanzines? Yeah, totally. I used to get sold them at gigs as far back as I can remember. The Birthday Party, the Fall, Dead Can Dance, Factory bands. The first ones I remember were pretty dull, because I was buying them in 1982 and 83, and they were writing about bands like the Inca Babies or the Folk Devils or the Luddites. It was all pretty boring. I didn’t see the point of them for a while, because the music papers existed and these fanzines weren’t really doing anything different. It wasn’t until 85 that I started seeing fanzines that made sense, because by then the NME was putting Courtney Pine on the cover and writing about Green on Red, and things I didn’t get. You mean the explosion of the C86-era fanzines? Yes. I moved to Peterborough because I couldn’t afford a flat on my own in glamorous, high-priced Croydon. I was working at [record shop] Our Price, and I got a transfer to Our Price in Cambridge, so it was an 80-mile round trip to work every day. Then I moved to Virgin in Peterborough when a job came up there. I was a fish out of water – I’d never lived outside suburban London before. I fell in with a bunch of blokes who’d been talking about doing a fanzine for ages, and then I came along and said we should do it. So we did it. That was Pop Avalanche. That went well, so I thought me and Pete Wiggs could do one called Caff. Did Our Price and Virgin let you sell the fanzine in the shops? No, but it never occurred to me to ask. They wouldn’t have done anyway. But some of the big chains could be quite adventurous in those days, because often they had their own buyers, so they had their own identities. Even WH Smith did – the Reading branch was particularly strong on metal for a while, and its record counter had all the NWOBHM stuff. I’ve read about big-city branches of HMV and Virgin with interesting ranges of stock. Yes, Virgin certainly had that. I remember the Virgin in Croydon being like that. When the Joy Division flexi came out, they had a stack on the counter and you could just help yourself. I think I took 10. I took a lot. Peterborough wasn’t like that, though. It was quite soul destroying. On a Saturday, people would come in and they wouldn’t even buy numbers six to 10, they’d only buy the Top 5. When I’d been working in Epsom Our Price it was a lot more interesting. I remember one bloke coming in and buying Forever Changes. I told him it was one of my favourite albums, and he said, “Oh, I bought it when it came out, but my old copy’s got a bit of a warp. I’m going to throw it away. You can have it if you want.” So I’ve got an original Forever Changes. Warped. Things like that never happened in Peterborough. In the interviews around the original release of Foxbase Alpha, you all talk about how you made that music to share your tastes. Was that why you worked in record shops? Or was it just to get discounted records? Both. There were a lot of Chelsea soul-fan hooligans who used to come into the Epsom shop in ’84, ’85 to buy soul. So I did a Top 10 soul reissues and put it out in the racks. And I got in trouble for that. For using my initiative. Because I hadn’t cleared it with the heavy-metal fan manager. I think that explains my residual dislike of heavy metal. One thing that often goes unremarked on in coverage of British indie culture – except in David Cavanagh’s book about Creation – is the importance of Channel 4, which helped repopularise trash culture, the 60s pop art aesthetic, French and continental styles, and mixed it all up with the brashness of contemporary pop culture. So you’d get The Munsters, The Avengers, The Tube and a Godard movie on the same evening. It created a cultural melting point that was really attractive to a certain kind of person. Yes, definitely. I used to tape so many of those films – buying blank videotapes cost so much back then. I’d try to tape all the Truffaut films, all the British kitchen sink films. It was the first channel to show [the Monkees’ film] Head. I’d read so much about it and never seen it – that seems quite hard to comprehend now. But a lot of things that you’d see referenced were hard to see and hear. The Byrds’ albums had all been deleted, for example. You could get a couple of compilations and that was it. Channel 4 was definitely important. Though I hated The Tube. It was so long, and it was on every week. You always seemed to have half an hour of Tears for Fears. I guess C86 was exciting, then, because it felt like it was “ours”. For people who had been too young for punk and found goth a bit unappealing. It also, if you were a nice kid, didn’t feel dangerous. Most importantly, it felt as if all those people making records were watching Channel 4 at the same time we were. And I didn’t feel scared to talk to people in bands, so I ended up getting to know those people. Obviously, doing a fanzine, I had to talk to them anyway. But it definitely felt like these were my people. Which doesn’t really explain Foxbase Alpha. But it’s part of it. I think C86 is the part of Foxbase Alpha that people ignore, in favour of the clubbing part of it. Because I think, in sensibility, it’s very much an indiepop record, even if it doesn’t sound like one. Especially in its fetishisation of the 60s. What it reminds me of more than any actual record is the collaged covers I used to do for mixtapes with bits from 60s Penguin book covers – the photos and the quotes that are all unrelated but work together. Yes, we made mixtapes. And we made them before we did the fanzine. Someone made me one called Don’t Put That Sausage in Your Mouth, Mrs Worthington. You wouldn’t have given that to a girl. You’d put bits between the tracks – bits of films on Channel 4, bits of adverts, bits of the Dangerous Brothers. So Tough [Saint Etienne’s second album] was exactly that, and it even had bits we’d taken from our cassettes. With pop art, I didn’t know anything about that until 1985, but that was absolutely mind-blowing. So, Bob, what did you actually do on Foxbase Alpha? I get asked this all the time. I was accused in the pub the other day of doing nothing. No, clearly you do something. But what is it? The back covers of Saint Etienne records don’t exactly define it. How did you actually make records? Did you go in with a flow chart to explain to Ian Catt, the engineer, what you needed him to do? Kind of. Let’s have a think. How would we have done something back then? We’d start with a loop, then work out a bassline and build up from there. Did you have the skills to make a loop yourselves? No. We needed someone to do it. We had to go to Ian Catt’s studio. Most good engineers can play most instruments reasonably well, and Ian’s certainly one of them. So it would be at the level of you humming him the melody or the bassline? Yeah. Or playing him a chord change off a record and telling him we wanted the chord change to be like that. Working with Ian you’d learn that adding a ninth makes a chord change richer – we just picked stuff up. I never wanted to become a musician, because I thought that if I knew how things were meant to work, I wouldn’t be able to do the things I wanted to do. I’m absolutely an amateur, because expertise would exclude doing anything new. That’s my philosophy. Although Pete’s managed to build himself a studio and become a proper musician in the last 25 years. I’ve been reading some old interviews with you, and there’s one with Jim Arundel in Melody Maker where you all get annoyed at the suggestion you’re a clever group. Come off it. Of course you were a clever group. Clever’s a bit of a problematic word. Does it mean arch? We used to be called ironic all the time. We didn’t like things that suggested we were using reference points because we thought they were funny, rather than because we liked them. I remember in that interview he refused to believe we liked Dazzle Ships by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, which these days is accepted as a great record. That album was a huge influence on us – a massive pop group putting together two or three recognisable pop songs and loads of found sounds. But what’s clever? Where does that come from? You made an album with a very clear worldview and aesthetic sense, employing your knowledge to locate the sources of the material you wanted, and with the intelligence to deploy those sources correctly. You could be a 60s-inspired pop group, using 60s sources, and be recognisably stupid, but you weren’t. That’s true. I never felt particularly clever myself. I think what annoyed us was clever and ironic being seen as the same thing. Betty Boo never got called clever, and I could never see any difference between us. You also get defensive in those old interviews about the idea that you might be elitist. That really baffled me. It seemed really obvious – making a song called Join Our Club doesn’t mean you’re being sarcastic. I understand where the idea that you were elitist came from. You’re singing about a super-cool London … We’d only moved there six months before! The people hearing your music don’t know that. They hear a group writing about cool London, filled with carefully chosen references to pop culture they might well not know. They’re getting a display of impeccable taste from people dressed like they’ve come out of Blow Up. That was the opposite of what we trying to do. It’s interesting you say that. I used to read interviews with Julian Cope [of the Teardrop Explodes] or Nick Heyward of [Haircut 100] and they would talk about their influences really openly, and it was like opening a door: if you like what I do, here’s where it all comes from. We probably overdid that, and it looked like we were showing off. Are you surprised at the affection in which Foxbase Alpha is still held, 25 years on? I am. But I’d also be disappointed if it was people’s favourite Saint Etienne record, because I don’t think it’s the best one. At the same time, I know as a pop fan that people tend to like the first album by a group most, because it’s the moment of discovery, and the one that captures the band’s youth, so I can understand it. But it’s always sounded like a scrapbook to me. The 25th anniversary edition of Foxbase Alpha is out now on vinyl and double CD, via Heavenly. A deluxe box set edition is released on 6 January. This interview is an edited version of one that appears in the sleevenotes for the box set.\n",
      "The 10 best things… to do this week Exhibitions William Eggleston Even if you aren’t able to name one of US snapper William Eggleston’s works, you will almost certainly recognise their defining characteristic: that almost absurd sunburst of colour saturation, which adds a lingering mystery to otherwise routine scenes. This major National Portrait Gallery survey profiles 100 photographs from the 1960s onwards, charting his progression from distrusted outsider to celebrated artist. Theatre Hug Being sung at while blindfolded, by a stranger who also has their arms wrapped around you might sound like a truly hellish ordeal, but Verity Standen’s polyphonic work has had the opposite effect on many. Indeed, some have been reduced to tears by this immersive experience. Film Ghostbusters Who you gonna call to drag a franchise kicking and screaming into the modern age? Well, Paul Feig, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy would probably be a decent start. The good news is that this all-female remake has received largely positive notices and, to be honest, even if it hadn’t, we’d still advocate seeing it just to stick it to the trolls.

      "Puro Instinct: Autodrama review – dangerous dreampop LA sisters Piper Durabo and Skylar Cielo made, in 2011’s Headbangers in Ecstasy, the bloggiest of all blog band albums. Their second takes its template – hazy dreampop, synth haze, slightly gothic guitar – and explores a darker Hollywood delirium. On Peccavi and Tell Me there are hints of Madonna’s early pep, but dreamy and dissipated, with Durabo intoning about “wishing fiction into fact” and urging you to “forget about tomorrow”. LA’s mystical side surfaces in Six of Swords, Scorpio Rising and the title track’s sample of the occultist Manly P Hall, while End of an Era introduces an anti-war sentiment and a delicious, doomy lassitude. If the songwriting isn’t always the match of the sheen, the best moments here – Panarchy, What You See, Autodrama – are dangerously seductive.\n",
      "Let’s Eat Grandma review – frighteningly inventive duo rip up girl-group cliches From their ominous name to the impudent, blank expressions they wear, Let’s Eat Grandma don’t just eschew girl-group stereotypes – they rip them to shreds with fiendish delight. Formed by friends Jenny Hollingworth, 17, and Rosa Walton, 16, LEG provide a dazzling, befuddling glimpse into teenage life as expressed through dark-edged fantasies and experimental pop. The duo, who share an uncanny physical and saccharine-sweet vocal similarity, amp up the weird factor with spooky synths and eerie recorders. Shrouded in black, barricaded on stage by a bank of keyboards and hidden behind curtains of long wavy hair, it’s almost impossible to tell them apart. Facing one another for the vigorous hand-clapping intro of Deep Six Textbook, they resemble baby-faced versions of pre-Raphaelite heroine Elizabeth Siddal. But, as they bend forward, then slowly rise up to face the crowd, there’s something of The Shining’s scary Grady twins about the pair. The thing most frightening about their music, however, is its sheer inventiveness. The frustration of schoolwork is vented against hymn-like, humming synths and a soulful saxophone, the story of Rapunzel is sung by Walton with vengeful sweetness, while Hollingworth plays an accusatory rhythm on drums with lashings of cymbal. Both girls move between their instruments – which include lead guitar and glockenspiel – with practised ease and, having formed the band in 2013, the songs are played with tight abandon. It’s when LEG set their innocent fairytales to hedonistic club beats on Eat Shiitake Mushrooms and the stunning Donnie Darko that they create something not just bewitching, but mould-breaking.

      "La Femme: Mystère review – alluring French indiepop For the non-Francophone, at least, La Femme’s second album lives up to its title. Mystère – delivered in blank, affectless voices, by male and female voices – is an alluring grab-bag of styles, from synthpop to surf-rock to Stereolabish indie motorik, to near-baroque guitar picking, to faux-Morricone western soundtracks, to an almost pastoral psychedelia. The stylistic range is wide enough to keep Mystère varied, and to stave off boredom – despite the album being about 20 minutes too long – but its parameters are also logical enough that each song sounds like it follows naturally from the last, rather than being a jarring leap. Goodness knows what they’re singing about, though that’s very much my fault rather than theirs; in any case, it doesn’t matter when the music this expertly conceived: it’s recognisably the work of an indie band, but not one constrained by preconceived notions of what indie must be, and it’s well worth your time.\n",
      "Nostalgia for things that never happened After recent events, some will already be nostalgic for a pre-Trump world. Yet nostalgia is a feeling of familiarity which doesn’t always connect to actual memories. Indeed those who wanted Trump to make America great again were harking back to a version of the country that never really existed. Research has found that the brain systems which control recognition and familiarity are quite different from each other. The two usually work together but can be activated separately, meaning it’s possible to feel a strong sense of acquaintanceship with a place or thing, when in fact you have never been here or used it before. This is why you can completely forget where and when you were introduced to someone, but just know that you’ve seen them before. Familiarity is instant, whereas memory recall can be a slow process - with lots of effort, it’s sometimes possible to remember the room where you met them, or the time of year it was. These details can then help unearth the full memory, something we should rely upon more than fleeting familiarity, especially in the post-factual world we live in.

      "Farage is now Britain’s face at the EU: petty, unlovable, essentially terrified In a crowded field, I think it was the flag that was the killer. The absolute state of that flag. Nigel Farage’s desktop Union Jack, with its little sucker pad leeching obnoxiously on to the unlovely beech of the European parliament chamber. Part of the genius of the TV series The Office was its ability to distil all human life down to a series of recognisable archetypes most people had encountered at work. To see Farage there with his desktop flag was to suddenly and irrevocably understand it: the UK is the Gareth Keenan of Europe. This is how we must look to those still condemned to share continent-space with us: petty, unlovable, essentially terrified, our workplace set up in a show of cod-martial defiance, which in fact only flags up our raging insecurity. Farage has been building up to this moment his entire political life, as he tells everyone at every single opportunity. In which case, how is it humanly possible that his speech to the European parliament today could be so artless, so crass, a scarcely refined version of some England fans’ infamous recent chant: “Fuck off Europe, we voted out”? To couch it in the sort of imbecilic historical inaccuracy which is the only language Farage understands: this speech was so bad that they’re now quits with us for saving them in the second world war. You may disagree with this reading of the war; Nigel would regard it as hugely overcomplicated. This, he repeated once more, was a victory against “big politics”. “Virtually none of you”, he bellowed at the MEPs, “have ever done a job in your lives.” Watching him was like watching the live abortion of Churchill’s oratorial legacy. As the latter’s grandson Nicholas Soames observed: “Appalling ghastly performance by that dreadful cad Farage in the European parliament. #hownottoinfluence.” Agreed. There is soft power, and then there is politics as erectile dysfunction. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult not to speculate as to the psychological underpinnings of the Farage condition. “When I came here 17 years ago,” he shouted, failing to hide his nervous elation, “you all laughed at me. Well I have to say: you’re not laughing now, are you?” He made it, you losers! He got out. He’s in the big leagues now. He’s the guy who just turned up to his school reunion in a white limo with two dead-eyed escorts on his arm. Above all, the performance offered a reminder that Farage makes everything in which he is involved a race to the bottom. The opposite of a Midas, he may as well be nicknamed Brownfinger. His excruciatingly aggressive display eventually drew boos from the chamber. “Ladies and gentlemen, I understand you’re emotional,” urged the assembly president. “But you’re acting like Ukip.” Farage was loving it, just as his financial backer in the provisional wing of the leave campaign is revelling in their legitimisation. Arron Banks has spent much of his time since the weekend laughing at reports of racist and xenophobic incidents on Twitter. Two weeks ago he couldn’t even book 75% of Bucks Fizz for his Brexit concert ; now he’s taking a triumphalist dump on 50 years of race relations policy. Meanwhile, presumably in a doomed attempt to own it – certainly out of an inability to transcend it – Farage embraces his smallness. The victory against “big politics”, he stressed again to the European parliament, was for “the little people”. Incidentally, during the general election campaign last year, I was in a Grimsby pub where Farage’s supporters were waiting for him in a long-scheduled visit . He blew them out to go and have fish and chips with reality television star Joey Essex. Footsoldiers of Ukip, they were crestfallen and couldn’t understand it. Yes, Farage is as elitist as the rest of them. Even the central London victory party for his senior referendum campaign staff was stratified, featuring a VIP snug into which he retreated for most of the night. And still he rises. This time, the political leader who’s had more farewell tours than Barbra Streisand isn’t going anywhere. Whenever I touched on Farage’s malevolent guiding spirit during the referendum campaign itself, I was pleased to take all sorts of optimistic correspondence explaining that as soon as a successful leave vote was achieved, Farage’s work would be done, and he would retire triumphantly into the sunset. How’s that working out for ya? As reports of racist and xenophobic incidents across Britain intensify, Farage appears on Channel 4 news to warn ominously against what he detects as “backsliding” in the leadership of the official Vote Leave campaign. My suspicion is that these two strands of post-referendum fallout will come together in what we might call “ever closer union”. All sides of leave know they can’t deliver all they promised – even most of what they promised – and the coming anger will serve as Farage’s greatest recruiting sergeant. Indeed, he may seem like the cuddly option compared to some. Still, don’t take it from me. Let’s play out with the UK’s second biggest cheerleader in the European parliament, Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front. Turning to Farage after his speech, she smiled, and declared: “Look at how beautiful history is!”\n",
      "Motörhead's Bomber – watch an exclusive track from Lemmy's last tour Up until his death in December 2015, Lemmy Kilmister continued to front those thunderous titans of rock’n’roll, Motörhead. “For as long as I can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick,” he told the in August last year. “Or even if I do have to use a stick.” In November 2015, UDR Records made the decision to record Motörhead’s two sold-out shows at the Zenith in Munich, Germany; footage that would turn out out to be the last documentation of the group performing live. Following Lemmy’s death on 28 December, two days after he was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive cancer, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed that without their frontman and bassist, the band would no longer continue. Scheduled for a June release, Clean Your Clock – a live DVD, CD, Vinyl and Blu-ray album – captures the bone-rattling impact of the Motörhead live experience and features a career retrospective, including Stay Clean, Metropolis, When the Sky Comes Looking for You, Ace of Spades and Bomber, an exclusive video of which you can watch below. • This article was first launched on 29 April 2016 and temporarily removed because of a rights issue with the video.

      "Copy-and-paste songwriting for a switched-on world Over the last couple of years, there has been a terrible trend in pop music. It most commonly manifests itself in a dance-pop track that lifts a hook or refrain from a well-known song and – with the aid of mind-numbing repetition and a house beat – transforms it into something just far enough removed from its source material to be classed as an original. See 99 Souls’ The Girl Is Mine, which takes samples from Girl by Destiny’s Child and Brandy and Monica’s The Boy Is Mine to form something painfully derivative of both, or Duke Dumont’s No 1 hit I Got U from 2014, which took bits of Whitney Houston’s My Love Is Your Love, put them in a different order, and gave them to Kelli-Leigh to sing. Yet as dismal as the situation may seem, the success this half-arsed school of songwriting has enjoyed feels merely like a blip in the history of the sample, still the most significant and exciting characteristic of 21st-century pop music. Now – 30 years since hip-hop brought the technique to the mainstream – a new generation of artists are developing it into something less crude and more creative. But while musicians such as Kanye West continue to layer increasingly jarring samples densely and awkwardly into a new work, for others this age of allusion is materialising in another form. Hold Up – Beyoncé’s staggeringly frank bat-in-hand battlecry against the self-negation of infidelity – is a matryoshka doll of a song. It opens with its chorus, a bastardised dancehall version of the song Maps by 00s indie stalwarts the Yeah Yeah Yeahs; the famous “They don’t love you like I love you” refrain set over a dub rhythm and distant wailing horns, and bookended by the track’s title. For the track’s finale, Beyoncé bursts into Turn My Swag On by Soulja Boy, a song that was transformed into an R&B diva standard by Keri Hilson (which found fame in the UK thanks to Cher Lloyd’s 2011 X Factor audition – to this day probably the high-water mark of the Simon Cowell conglomerate’s output). That idea of singing a bit of somebody else’s song in the middle of yours (known technically as interpolation) might just be the future of pop music. After all, in a world where practically every new track feels like a haunted house beset by ghosts of melodies past, deliberately evoking another song seems like the audacious and self-aware thing to do. Suitably, a new generation of neo-soul and alt R&B wannabes are at it: 19-year-old singer Jorja Smith’s Blue Lights, for example, has her singing the bombastic hook from Dizzee Rascal’s Sirens as part of a sultry soul number, while 5050 by south London singer Ray Blk begins with a warped version of the “love me, love me” portion of the Cardigans’ Lovefool. Unlike the borrowed sentiments of the aforementioned electropop nightmares, these sung snatches are a way to enrich songs with the emotion and nostalgia (Dizzee Rascal is akin to Woody Guthrie for Generation Z) of the original songs. Although currently finding a home in new and inventive R&B, interpolation is a trend that traverses the genres. The Maps segment of Hold Up was originally created by Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig, who had the idea to supplement the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ lyrics with the refrain “There’s no other God above you / what a wicked way to treat the man who loves you” (changed slightly for the Beyoncé version) and then set it over a plucked Andy Williams track (the segment was completed by Diplo). This cross-genre appropriation is characteristic of the pop-will-eat-itself way Koenig works in his indie songwriting, too: in Vampire Weekend’s 2014 track Step, Koenig sings the lyrics of Oakland rap group Souls of Mischief’s Step To My Girl to the tune of the song’s sampled sax melody, while Vampire Weekend’s most famous track, Oxford Comma, alludes to Lil Jon’s “to the window, to the wall” lyric. Unsurprisingly, rap continues to lead the charge too, with much grime locked in a vortex of references to other lyrics from the genre, while also lifting from other styles: Beenie Man’s Who Am I (Sim Simma) popped up, doomily reimagined, as the chorus to Section Boyz’ Bimma. Although currently there is little distinction made between straightforward sampling (taking a passage from somebody else’s recording and inserting it into your own) and interpolation, the latter does seem significantly different. It suggests not only total submersion in music – echoing the way some people now live their lives, thanks to portable devices that provide unlimited access to an unlimited catalogue of songs – but also the way music is absorbed into the cultural consciousness: in memorable snippets, melodies recreated in people’s heads and with their own voices. It also echoes the copy-and-paste methods of online identity assemblage on platforms such as Tumblr and Instagram, where the clever and cool reference is king. As this type of allusion-heavy songwriting prepares to dominate in line with the resurgence of rap and R&B, get ready for a subtler, stranger style of pop cannibalisation.\n",
      "Madness pay tribute to Prince Buster – 'A huge impact on everything we did' Madness – who took their name from one his songs, whose first single was about him, and whose breakthrough hit was a cover of one of his tracks – paid tribute to ska legend Prince Buster on Sunday. The band were appearing at Radio 2’s Festival in a Day in Hyde Park in London, and dedicated a version of their first single The Prince to Buster, who died on Thursday. Madness singer Suggs told the BBC how crucial Prince Buster had been to the group. “The fact he came from the streets and he had a terrific sense of humour and energy – it really appealed to us and it had a huge impact on everything we did, really.” He added: “It’s like the Monty Python thing about the Romans: ‘What did Prince Buster ever do for us?’ A great deal indeed.” Madness’s second single, One Step Beyond, was a cover of a Prince Buster song, and their first top 10 hit. They also covered his song Madness. Other heroes of the Two Tone and British ska movement have paid tribute to Buster. “From hip-hop to grime to dancehall to reggae, there can be very little which hasn’t been influenced to some extent by Prince Buster and his combination of singing and talking over rhythms,” said Jerry Dammers, founder of the Specials and the Two Tone label.\n",
      "'At Thriller Live, there's a fight in the stalls' … my three-week journey into jukebox musicals On Saturday afternoon at 4pm, a landmark was passed. Thriller Live opened its 3,000th performance at the Lyric theatre in London. A cheerful tribute to Michael Jackson, it was already the longest-running show in the Lyric’s history – and seven years after opening, the theatre still sells an average of 80% of its 915 seats for each performance. It is already booking until April next year, and a regional tour that started last week is taking in eight towns and cities between now and July. It’s all testament to the boundless appetite of the British public for hearing songs performed by people who sometimes – but not usually – look like the people who first performed them, and who sometimes – but not usually – sound like the people who first performed them. The first jukebox musical in Britain was Jack Good and Ray Cooney’s Elvis, which opened in 1977, the show that helped turn Shakin’ Stevens from a John Peel favourite and stalwart of Communist party benefits into a staple of light entertainment. A decade or so later, Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story, opened in the West End, running for 13 years, and ensuring a generation of Londoners became incapable of hearing Holly’s name without appending the Sun quote from the posters – “It’s Buddy brilliant!” The explosion in jukebox musicals, the point at which they became the go-to shows for impresarios seeking a guaranteed buck, came when Abba granted permission for their songs to feature in Mamma Mia!, which opened in 1999 and is still running. Since then, pretty much any artist with a catalogue greater than a couple of albums and a fanbase wealthy enough to pay for theatre tickets has had their own show. The fact is, though, that they aren’t a guaranteed buck. For every We Will Rock You, there’s a Viva Forever – the Spice Girls show that lost £5m and closed within a year. Nevertheless, they are still thriving, and so with Motown the Musical opening, I was set the challenge of going to as many West End jukebox musicals as I could, and trying to work out – as the ’s music editor, rather than a theatre critic – the appeal. There are five on my list, culminating in Motown. Before that, in three weeks, I have to fit in Beautiful – The Carole King Musical, Thriller Live, Jersey Boys and Sunny Afternoon. At Thriller Live, I’m sitting next to a group of women who want to know why I’ve been taking notes. I tell them, and ask in return why they’ve come to see a particularly slick Britain’s Got Talent version of Michael Jackson’s music. Colette, in the seat next to me, explains that it’s not all about the music, and it’s not all about the theatre. It’s a social thing – she and her friends come down from Cheshire two or three times a year to do some shopping and see a show. And they like jukebox musicals – they know the songs, it’s a bit of fun. They’ve already seen most of the shows on my list, but they’re ruling out Motown, at least until good seats are available at more reasonable prices (top price tickets in the stalls are an eye-watering £120). It’s certainly true that jukebox musical audiences are not like the crowds at gigs or plays. They’re chattier than you get at Wolf Hall, for starters. During Thriller Live, excitingly, a fight breaks out in the stalls – just at the point we are being told what a great force for good in the world Michael Jackson was – which you rarely get at the Donmar. They’re also more forgiving than crowds at gigs; they greet every performance with enthusiasm, and it only takes the slightest encouragement for an audience to be on its feet, clapping along. There are three kinds of jukebox musical: the one in which the song-and-dance routines are churned out one after the other, with no pretence at plot, just a little bit of narration (Thriller Live); the one that shoehorns songs from one artist or genre into a plot unrelated to the artists concerned (We Will Rock You, Rock of Ages – the hair metal musical that was by some distance the worst night I’ve ever had in a theatre, in which Starship’s We Built This City was cued up by a discussion about urban planning); and the biography. Apart from Thriller, all the shows I see fit into this last category. The big problem with the biographical format, as everyone who’s ever watched a rockumentary knows, is that there’s really only one story: it begins with camaraderie and passion and excitement, it progresses to conquering the world, at which point ennui and conflict creep in (often exacerbated by drugs and alcohol), and the principals start to hate each other. Finally, but not always, there’s resolution – the reunion, the realisation that the best times were before they got famous, when it was all for fun and no one was making money out of them. Motown, Beautiful, Sunny Afternoon and Jersey Boys all cleave to that path to varying degrees. Motown sees the soul label through the eyes of its founder, Berry Gordy, portraying its story not as about Gordy managing to alienate key artists and writers by screwing them over, but how – like an R&B Lear – he was betrayed by those he had made great, until finally they come to honour him (bizarrely it also manages to almost completely excise Stevie Wonder, the label’s presiding genius, and portray Smokey Robinson as Detroit’s genial village idiot). Beautiful has the slight problem that Carole King is the least interesting person in her own story – a writer of incredible melodies, whose greatest aspiration appeared to be living in a nice house in the New York suburbs – and so has to rely on the characters of Gerry Goffin, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil to generate drama. Sunny Afternoon has the story of the wars between the Kinks’ Ray and Dave Davies to provide its heart, and it’s also the only one of the shows that does something with its songs other than set them up with a series of “Gee, you’ll never guess what I’ve just written!” – as when Stop Your Sobbing becomes a commentary on his relationship with his first wife, Rasa. Jersey Boys, the tale of the Four Seasons, has a surprisingly strong story arc, thanks to the group’s links to the New Jersey mob, and the conflict that generated between their artistic heart – Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio – and their founder, Tommy DeVito. Everyone’s stories are condensed into a series of snapshots from a brief period. Beautiful begins in the late 50s, and ends with Carole King releasing Tapestry in 1971. Sunny Afternoon, to all intents and purposes, ends with the release of Lola in 1970, despite an encore that shifts us forward to the band headlining Madison Square Garden in 1981. Both Motown and Jersey Boys dwell on the 60s, skipping through the subsequent decades in moments. But you’re not going to these shows for the history, you’re going for the songs. Sadly, Motown fails here. Too many songs are truncated, too many minor tracks included at the expense of classics (in this version of the story, Diana Ross going solo is the defining moment in Motown history). Thriller Live can’t really go wrong, given the riches at its disposal. Jersey Boys makes a decent stab at making the case for Bob Gaudio as the Brian Wilson of the east coast. Beautiful passes in a blur of wonderful songs, but the winner is Sunny Afternoon. That’s not because Davies’ songs are better – he has perhaps written fewer unimpeachable classics than King, and no individual artist has a catalogue to match Motown – but because Sunny Afternoon is the only show that treats its music as rock’n’roll. It’s a surprise and a thrill to realise You Really Got Me is going to be played at gig volume rather than cabaret volume, and it’s the only show in which you feel the thwump of the bass in your sternum. By the end of my run, I’m starting to feel as if I’m starring in my own rockumentary. What started in enthusiasm has progressed to ennui – another night, another show. The interval drinks begin to assume a central role. Like a touring musician carping about hotels and tour buses, I’m obsessing over legroom in the theatres, and beginning to hate the people sitting around me – put away your phone! Stop kicking my seat! Don’t take up the whole armrest! Come the last night, at the Motown show, I finally crack. I slip out before the encore begins, to the surprise and irritation of the other people in my row. All I can think about is getting to the pub. It’s time to stop this madness. Stop! In the Name of Love. This article was amended on 16 March 2016. Mamma Mia! opened in 1999, not 1989 as originally stated.\n",
      "These anti-Brexit posters show just what we lose by leaving the EU The artist Wolfgang Tillmans has said what I feel: “What is lost is lost forever,” he warns over a blue and violet image of the Earth from above, apparently one of the photographer’s pictures taken through the window of a passenger jet – an image of boundless space, longing and desire. He is talking about the EU. Tillmans has created a series of passionate posters arguing why Britain should stay in Europe and urging young voters in particular to make sure they are registered to vote in the EU referendum before 7 June. Should artists weigh in and lecture people on why we should vote to remain in the EU? This is territory where many have already been stunned into silence. In a pre-emptive strike, the Brexit side scored easy points against cultural celebrity Emma Thompson after some comments she made at a film festival about what Britain might look like out of Europe. The lesson appeared to be that members of the cultural elite – who include Turner prize-winner Tillmans – are advised to stay quiet, or risk being mocked as part of the Europhile establishment the leavers scorn. Nobody commissioned Tillmans to make these 25 overtly political works, which combine lyrical images with bold words. He is acting on his own initiative (aided by his London and Berlin studio assistants) as a citizen concerned the remain campaign lacks passion. “We have reached a critical moment that could prove to be a turning point for Europe as we know and enjoy it – one that might result in a cascade of problematic consequences and political fall-out,” he writes on his website, where the posters are available to download and share. “What is lost is lost forever” is the one that moves me most because it expresses exactly what is at stake. All the passion about the EU debate may seem to be on the Brexit side, with their enthusiasm for national sovereignty and visions of a sceptred isle. This emotion has suddenly turned from a strength to a weakness, as damning data on the potential economic woes of a Brexit piled up and Barack Obama delivered his cool blow. Patriotic feelings are all the Brexiteers appear to have. In place of economic reason, they resort to absurd vitriol. But there’s a long way to go, and emotions continue to matter. Tillmans’ image of a lost horizon captures what I suspect is the hidden emotional truth for millions of people. We may not be out there ranting, but if Britain voted to leave we would wake up on 24 June with a terrible sense of loss and isolation, a sadness that would be hard to shake. Britain outside Europe would feel like a foreign land to its own people. Whose country would such an isolationist island be? Not mine – I’d be lost there. Incredibly, leave campaigner and justice minister Dominic Raab has conceded that Britons may need visas to visit Europe if they vote to go. What kind of backward step in history are these people contemplating? A visa to visit Europe? Tillmans expresses the tragedy of such an outcome in a poster that adapts the words of the poet John Donne: “No man is an island. No country by itself.” In another, over an ethereal blue and orange photograph, he asks: “If people like Rupert Murdoch, Nigel Farage, George Galloway, Nick Griffin, and Marine Le Pen want Britain to leave the EU … Where does that put you?” I suspect Tillmans is not on Nigel Farage’s radar. But he can use his more selective fame to directly address younger voters who need to register and vote. And other artists should follow his lead if they can express themselves as naturally and sympathetically as he does in these posters. The photograph he matches with his revision of Donne’s immortal lines is a view from the sky of a coastline battered by the waves. Instead of white cliffs with green grass behind them, as in some Brexit fantasy island, the land here is cut off from a wider world and looks like a desert. Isolate this island and it will die.\n",
      "Leicester fans celebrate football's unlikeliest win Fairy tales really do come true after all it seems. Less than 10 months after starting the season as 5,000-1 outsiders, Leicester City is celebrating its first Premier League title after rivals Tottenham Hotspur failed to clinch the victory needed to keep their own hopes alive. As well as gifting Leicester with one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time, Tottenham’s 2-2 draw with Chelsea set off a chain reaction ranging from a multimillion-pound hammering for bookies to the prospect of Gary Lineker now having to make good on a promise to present Match of the Day in his underwear should the club where he started his sporting career win the league. In the Midlands, fans and players got down to the serious business of celebrating at venues ranging from heaving pubs to the home of talismanic striker Jamie Vardy. For the team’s players – who could have clinched the title on Sunday at Old Trafford but could only manage a 1-1 draw with Manchester United – the cauldron of Old Trafford had been swapped for hospitality at Vardy’s house. In the end, the title was delivered to Leicester courtesy of an equalising goal by Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, whose 83rd-minute strike squared the game with Spurs. As a wave of emotion surged from homes, pubs, community centres and other gatherings of fans in Leicester, the moment when the team’s players at Vardy’s house learned that they were champions was captured by defender Christian Fuchs in a video that immediately went viral. Vardy himself also didn’t disappoint those expecting a reaction on social media, posting an riposte to his Tottenham counterpart, Harry Kane, whose recently tweeted image of a pack of lions had been seen as a message designed to suggest that his side were hunting Leicester down. Without words, Vardy posted an image of the moment when one of the characters from the Lion King, Mufasa, falls to his death after struggling to gain a clawhold on a cliff face as a stampede takes place below. As car horns hooted outside his window, Leicester’s mayor, Peter Soulsby, told the : “We thought it couldn’t get any better 12 months ago when the eyes of the world were on us as we reinterred the bones of Richard III, but this is even better. “We are very proud of what is probably the most diverse city in Europe and in fact many people see the team as a metaphor because it shows what you can really achieve when you bring a diverse group of people together.” He added that the official celebrations will take place after the end of the season “although we will have two weeks of parties before then of course”. Alan Sugar, a former Spurs chairman, was among the first to send his congratulations, tweeting even before the final whistle: “Well done Leicester. Very well deserved and a demonstration that you don’t need £50m players.” There were also immediate congratulations from Downing Street, where the Twitter account of David Cameron sent out the message within seconds of the game finishing: “Many congratulations to Leicester. An extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.” On the other side of the political divide, shadow chancellor John McDonnell was drawing parallels between Leicester’s unlikely triumph and the elevation of another rank outsider: “Who would of predicted a year ago that Leicester would win the Premier League & Jeremy Corbyn would be Labour leader? Congrats to Leicester.” Lineker, no doubt turning some of his thoughts quietly to the garments he would soon have to don, described the result as the biggest shock of his lifetime, later telling the BBC: “If it means that I have to wear pants during Match of the Day then I suppose I look forward to it.” Having returned to Italy to fulfil a lunch date with his 96-year-old mother, Leicester’s manager, Claudio Ranieri, was meanwhile reported to have flown back on a private jet in time to watch the game at his flat in the Midlands. In the run-up to kick-off, pubs in Leicester had been heaving for a second night in a row with fans decked out in the club’s blue – even if some had initially appeared to be saving their pennies on a bank holiday weekend by watching the game at home before properly indulging themselves next weekend. Hazard’s equaliser changed all that though, sending thousands on to the streets of the city. At least 1,000 fans arrived at the team’s King Power stadium, where crowds chanted “Leicester ’til I die” and “Championes!” to mark the Foxes clinching the title. Richard Hamilton, 23, said: “It’s just amazing, the city has come out for this and it’s just brilliant for the fans and the city as a whole.” Other groups of fans celebrating in the city included Steve Robinson, 26, who told reporters: “This year I got married and had a baby, but this tops it all.”\n",
      "Lois Smith obituary My aunt Lois Smith, who has died aged 96, put her extraordinary energies into people and causes. An enthusiast, a starter, a provocateur, she set the scene in 1948 when she sought out a young Oxford film buff called Lindsay Anderson, who was set to train as a teacher, and persuaded him to make a film about her husband Desmond’s Yorkshire colliery equipment company. It was his first stab at directing, and they called it Meet the Pioneers. So began a friendship that continued until Anderson’s death in 1994 at Lois’s house in the Dordogne, where he was holidaying. It was Lois who looked after the funeral arrangements. Also in 1948, Lois had met the Hungarian-born artist Jean-Georges Simon when she saw a painting of his on a Wakefield gallery wall and demanded Desmond buy it. Death stalks this story, too, since when Desmond died tragically young in 1950, Lois installed Simon in the garden of her cottage in the Yorkshire Dales to carve the headstone for Desmond’s grave in Burnsall churchyard. Although she later trained as a social worker, Lois’s calling was as a sort of super groupie, intuitively understanding artistic talents and needs. She was a prime mover in setting up the Lindsay Anderson Memorial Foundation and the film-maker’s Stirling University archive, as well as the Jean-Georges Simon Trust: his paintings, drawings and archive had been left to her by the artist’s widow. Lois was the youngest child of Daisy (nee Raby) and Frank Martin, her father being a busy GP in Heaton, Bradford. She attended Cheltenham Ladies college, and at 20 married Desmond Sutcliffe; their children, Perry and Robin, were born in short order. Following Desmond’s death, she met and married Mickey Smith; their son, Stephen, was born in 1962. Mickey’s surveying job took the couple to London and Cornwall, but they returned to Yorkshire in 1976, divorcing in the mid-80s yet still interdependent. Lois set about shaking up Calderdale’s civic dignitaries, pinning down those she saw as offenders with her mixture of bluster, charm and ruthlessness. Indeed, she would argue the toss with anyone, stating opinions as if they were facts. Because she could also be open and warm, however, she made more friends than enemies. Lois is survived by Perry, Robin and Stephen, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n",
      "Mac Miller: The Divine Feminine review – gentle G-funk from a one-track mind There’s one thing on the mind of Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller, and it’s swinging between his legs. But he’s honest about his constant horn, and, audibly high off natural perfumes, parlays it into an album that worships and ogles in equal measure. The touchstones are D’Angelo, Aquemini-era Outkast, Chance the Rapper’s muted trumpets, and the psychedelic soul of Cee-Lo Green’s early solo LPs, with the latter turning up for some ruminative vocals on the gorgeous, sure-footed We. Other killer tracks include ever-moistening slow jam Skin, and smooth boogie workout Dang!, featuring a brilliantly wet-behind-the-ears turn from Anderson.Paak. Few lyrics are particularly arresting (on My Favourite Part, new girlfriend Ariana Grande is told that she doesn’t know how beautiful she is) and there’s some mid-album filler as Miller struggles to add hooks to cosmic G-funk. But the whole thing sits in an enticing spot between the barbecue and the bedroom.\n",
      "Beyoncé launches new 'visual album' Lemonade on HBO The surprise of releasing an album with no warning is perhaps a slightly overdone trick now, but the news that Beyoncé released her sixth solo album, called Lemonade, on Saturday night still managed to be the kind of event that confirms her status as arguably the world’s leading female pop star. The album was debuted at 9pm EST on Saturday night on the cable channel HBO. It took the form of a succession of music videos linked by poetry by Somali-British poet Warsan Shire. The directors of the videos included heavyweights like Mark Romanek. By the end of the hour-long broadcast, the album was available to stream on Tidal, backed by Jay-Z, Beyoncé’s husband. However, the state of the pair’s marriage is sure to come under scrutiny given the angry tone of the first few songs. The first video, for Pray You Catch Me, saw Beyoncé walking down the street and smashing up cars with a baseball bat, singing about a man who had betrayed her trust. Musically, the album is eclectic, moving into rock, country and jazz in places and including collaborations with Jack White, Diplo, James Blake, Kendrick Lamar and the Weeknd. Meanwhile the title seems inspired by the old adage, “If life hands you a lemon, make lemonade.” Lemonade also demonstrates Beyoncé’s increasing willingness and desire to express her political views. One of the films for Lemonade depicted the mothers of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin holding photographs of their sons. The album is also strongly feminist in tone, one song declaring “women don’t quit on themselves”. The arrival of Lemonade didn’t produce quite the same shockwaves as the release of Beyoncé, her previous album, on 13 December 2013. There had been no warning of that album, and for it to arrive – like the latest album, with a complete accompanying set of music videos – felt like a seismic event for the music industry. Though albums had been released with little or no notice, never before had an artist with as much commercial power as Beyoncé been able to release an album with no warning to complete surprise. This time, however, there had been hints that something was happening. First, Beyoncé released a new single, Formation, in February – her first new music since the 2013 album – then performed it at the Super Bowl halftime show. If it were possible for Beyoncé to raise her profile any higher, the Super Bowl show did it: her performance, a vigorous spectacle that paid tribute to the Black Panthers, of a song whose lyrics and video were clearly linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, provoked anger among police unions, some of whom threatened to withdraw security services from her concerts. That tour – the second clue that an album was imminent – begins on 27 April in Miami and comes to the UK at the end of June, with stadium shows in Sunderland, Cardiff, Manchester, London and Glasgow. It is part of a cluster of Beyoncé activity that also suggested there would be music coming imminently. Last week she launched a range of fashion sportswear, Ivy Park, selling through Top Shop in the UK. On Monday she released a trailer for Lemonade, a mysterious “world premiere event” that will be broadcast on the US network HBO on Saturday. The surprise release of her last album did not harm it commercially. Beyoncé entered the US Billboard chart at No 1, and became the fastest-selling album on iTunes worldwide. It’s estimated total sales of 5m beat the 3m copies sold of its predecessor, 4. Track listing for Beyoncé’s new album, Lemonade\n",
      "Bob Dylan: Fallen Angels review – unfaithful and lovely The thought strikes, part-way through Bob Dylan’s second album of standards from the mid-20th century American songbook, that it sounds like nothing so much as the unreleased soundtrack to a later Woody Allen movie. It has the same tastefully muted jazzy arrangements, the same love for the music combined with a slight sense of didacticism (Listen! You WILL love these songs as much as I do), the same oddly absurd disconnection from modernity. The arrangements aren’t faithful in any way to those that made these songs famous – That Old Black Magic becomes a rockabilly shuffle – but there’s a certain loveliness to them. It Had To Be You had yet another lease of life on the When Harry Met Sally soundtrack in 1989, but the version here makes you think not of Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal cracking wise to each other, but to the old couples interspersed throughout that film, reminiscing about when they fell in love. Fallen Angels sounds like another love letter to Dylan’s own youth, and it’s charming. Whether you would prefer listening to his readings of the songs, rather than to those by Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and so on is entirely your choice.\n",
      "Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The book that declared pop music dead In the spring of 1968, the former Queen magazine pop columnist Nik Cohn rented a cottage in Connemara on the west coast of Ireland. All of 22, he had fallen out of love with pop music, and he hid himself away for two months to write a cross between a memoir and a farewell letter. For Cohn, it felt like the end of an era of pop that was “intelligent and simple both”, that carried its implications lightly, that was “fast, funny, sexy, obsessive, a bit epic”. He sniffed pretension in the air as pop turned to rock, and he wanted to get it all down on paper before he completely lost interest. The confidently titled Pop from the Beginning moved from Bill Haley’s Rock Around the Clock in 1955 to the ebbing tide of psychedelia and the return to roots (Dylan’s John Wesley Harding, the Beatles’ “Lady Madonna”) of early 1968. Published in 1969, just as the Beatles disintegrated, Pop from the Beginning was the first definitive text on pop music. Cohn wrote in fast, short sentences; the book read like a series of 7in singles, with no room for deviation, no long solos, no flab at all. By the time it was reprinted as a paperback a year later, it had a new title – Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom – and a telltale subtitle: “the Golden Age of Rock”. Cohn had predicted the sea change; he had fallen out of love with pop just as the Beatles-led consensus years came to end: pop was split, hard left and right, between Radio 1 factory‑farmed pop (“Sugar, Sugar”) and self-conscious, album-based heavy rock (Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath). For Cohn, a teddy boy at heart, neither came close to the glamour and speed fix of the rapidly receding “golden age” he wrote about with such dash: Elvis’s “great ducktail plume and lopsided grin”, Phil Spector’s “beautiful noise”, and James Brown, “the outlaw, the Stagger Lee of his time”. Among the the reasons Cohn’s book has remained such a thrilling, inspirational read are its total confidence and absolute sense of finality. By 1969, Cohn considered John Lennon “self-pitying”, thought the Who were “going through the same old stunts”, and dismissed Pink Floyd as “very solemn, most artistic, boring almost beyond belief”. The new order spurned flash, and dressed down in T-shirts and denims; Cohn, disgusted, reacted in 1971 with a book on fashion called Today There Are No Gentlemen. He has never shown any inclination to write an updated edition of Awopbopaloobop. Nik Cohn grew up in postwar Derry. His father was a renowned historian, Norman Cohn, which may have put young Nik off anything approaching rigour in his writing. At 13, he spent a week in London, where he found a paperback of Alan Lomax’s Mister Jelly Roll: The Fortunes of Jelly Roll Morton, New Orleans Creole and Inventor of Jazz; the cover promised to explain how “he put the heat into hot music”. Jazz historians have dismissed large chunks of Morton’s life story as wishful thinking, while confirming that he was also a hugely significant talent and influence, but aged 13, Nik Cohn didn’t care for dry history, wasn’t remotely bothered that Morton had vamped up his past. He was absorbed by tales of pimps and voodoo queens, and pictured Mister Jelly Roll as the dust jacket described him, “wearing a hundred-dollar suit as sharp as a tipster’s sheet … the diamond in a front tooth gleaming like gaslight”. The book contained a map of New Orleans – Cohn memorised every street. As a Jewish kid growing up in sectarian Ulster, he felt like an outsider and sought escape in invention; Mister Jelly Roll fed right into a mythology of flash, violence and seven-day weekends that he had first discovered through Elvis Presley’s records, and became the biggest literary influence on Cohn’s career. Awopbopaloobop transferred the underworld grit, diamond-studded teeth and overflowing dresses in Cohn’s imagination to the glamour, the ostentation, the ruthlessness and grubbiness of the pop business. He would soon base the 1970 novel Arfur: Teenage Pinball Queen in his fictionalised New Orleans, now renamed Moriarty (“the foremost city of the nation, a compound of refinement and squalor, grace and depravity”), where there were now beautifully named quarters of Cohn’s own making – Jitney, Cicero and Savoy, “the wealthy St Jude and the shanty Canrush”. Cohn applied this fantastical approach to the real story of pop, cutting down people he thought were likely to diminish the music’s sense of fun and fast-moving disposability (Bob Dylan, the Doors, even the Beach Boys), and to praise outsiders, troublemakers, short-lived stars whose one major hit (Del Shannon’s “Runaway”, for instance) he considered to be worth as much as Van Morrison’s entire career. Trouser-tearing PJ Proby’s profile was elevated monstrously – with all of three top 10 hits to his name, Proby was given a whole chapter in Awopbopaloobop on the strength of his outsized ego and chaotic potential. This was significant and, at the time, outrageous – in 1969, it must have seemed that seriousness had won out for good, with levity confined to novelty singles and bubblegum. After all, it had only taken John Lennon six years to get from the lung-busting liberation of Twist And Shout to a concept album about Arthur Janov’s trauma-based primal scream therapy. Cohn took sides, and it wouldn’t have been a hard choice. Just as he had romanticised New Orleans, Cohn set to perfecting the story of pop, from the beginning. “My purpose was clear,” he wrote in 2004. He wanted “to capture the feel, the pulse” of what he called “Superpop”, with no dry discographies or chart positions. In doing this, he latterly admitted to adding baubles and colouring. Some of the stories, he wrote in Triksta (2005), were flat-out invented. I’d lay money on one of the embellished stories being his meeting with Gene Pitney in a hotel room, where Pitney “was talking business on a long-distance telephone … like a full-blown tycoon … tie twisted, sweatmarks under his armpits. Deals – they lit him up like neon.” I love Gene Pitney, I own a dozen of his albums and a stack of 45s, but I’d still admit that his public presentation could do with a little ornamentation. Cohn was cheeky. He thought he was doing acts such as Pitney a favour by making them seem more interesting and, most of the time, he was. It was showmanship. It was Hollywood. And it was a little depressing to read in Triksta that Cohn winced at his embellishments, and considered his younger self a fraud. In a new preface for the Vintage Classics edition of Awopbopaloobop, he seems a little more at ease: “Any man, at 70, who claims he relishes being confronted by his raw self at 22 is crazy or lying or both.” The main lesson I learned from reading Awopbopaloobop when I was 22, and a budding music writer, is that pop is all about myth-building – there’s really no such thing as authenticity or fraudulence. Many of the judgments he made in 1969 still seem mischievous. The Rolling Stones he considered heroic, but a spent force (the imminent Let It Bleed changed his mind in time for the paperback afterword); if they had “any sense of neatness, they’ll get themselves killed in an aircrash three days before their 30th birthdays”. Led Zeppelin he dealt with in a single word: “embarrassing”. Cohn liked his black music to come from black musicians, and his soul music on the rawer side. “Softness and tenderness, wistful ironies” he conceded as blindspots, describing Motown as mere “foot fodder” but having a lot of time for relatively minor practitioners such as Joe Tex, who he saw as “hugely smug” but with “great charm and inventiveness”. Tex didn’t make it easy for you to find your way in to his music. The way Cohn paints it, Tex isn’t just awkward, he’s barely likable. On his Vietnam song “I Believe I’m Gonna Make It”, a girlfriend’s letter overwhelms him with love and pride, and gives him so much inner strength that stands up and shoots dead two North Vietnamese soldiers. Joe Tex did not exude kindness. You reel back at Cohn’s words, and wonder why anyone would even bother listening to Tex’s records, but then he turns on a sixpence and reels you in with a couple of lines: “He’s funny, he really is, and he obviously enjoys himself. So his records turn into good clean dirt and you can’t resent them. You keep trying to disapprove but your principles slip. That’s how you get corrupted.” The writing is so bittersweet and succinct, the cadences so true. Cohn also pulls out plums by being at the heart of the story as it unfolded, chronicling forgotten truths. The Beatles are now regularly credited with making pop acceptable, elevating it from the realms of teenage delinquency, and forcing critics in the Sunday papers to consider pop stars as thinkers, not just purveyors of teenage noise. Cohn doesn’t doubt the group took pop from the back streets and into the art gallery (something he strongly disapproves of), but spots an earlier turning point in Adam Faith’s 1960 appearance on the BBC TV show Face to Face. An interview programme, hosted by John Freeman, Face to Face smelled strongly of importance – guests included Augustus John, Carl Jung and Tony Hancock. Acton boy Faith had quickly become one of the biggest British pop stars of the post rock’n’roll, pre-Beatles era by dint of a hiccoughing, Buddy Holly-like vocal style, so was not expected to do anything other than embarrass himself in front of Freeman. So when he spoke neatly and smoothly on national television about his admiration for Sibelius and The Catcher in the Rye it was a minor sensation. “Pop began to go up in the world,” says Cohn. “Slowly and humbly, admittedly, but upwards just the same.” Praising Adam Faith was never going to win you kudos from rock classicists, but Cohn wasn’t afraid of appearing uncool, or even plain wrong. Pseuds and bores, no matter how feted, were his real enemy, and he guessed the 70s would be a pretentious decade. At the conclusion of Awopbopaloobop, he predicted “formal works for pop choirs, pop orchestras; pop concerts held in halls … sounds and visuals combined … on something like a gramophone and TV set knocked into one”. Briskly, he had predicted progressive rock and MTV. Still he didn’t care; his love affair with pop was over. After Awopbopaloobop, he spent the 70s writing novels – the super-bleak King Death (1975), which he now considers a failure – and short pieces including the clubland story “Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night”, which morphed into Saturday Night Fever. But mostly he left music alone. Even if his thoughts had been entirely negative, I’d have loved to read Cohn on Marc Bolan, Joe Strummer, Prince, even Boyzone. It’s not hard to see why he can’t be bothered now, when you look at Britain’s current crop of top-selling acts: the milky Ed Sheeran, the glum foghorn Sam Smith, and Ellie Goulding, whose major characteristic seems to be that she loves going to the gym – they simply don’t cut it. You’d never call them superstars. It isn’t just that they don’t match up to the “golden age of rock” – even the vulgar neediness of Robbie Williams or Geri Halliwell in the recent past was something to latch on to, to love or to hate. Pop music needs writers like Nik Cohn to kick up trouble, to give albums anything other than four-star reviews, and that way maybe the musicians will also rise to the challenge. •Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom is reissued by Vintage Classics.

      "Eagles of Death Metal review – exultant crowd radiate a protective positivity Halfway through this cathartic show, Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes shouts: “Rock and roll will never die!” It’s the sort of off-the-peg, in-the-moment war cry you might hear at many gigs. From Hughes, however, it comes freighted with additional meaning. Eagles of Death Metal were originally conceived as a joke in a bar in 1998. Now the band will always be associated with violence after their gig at the Bataclan in Paris last November was interrupted by three extremists armed with Kalashnikovs, grenades and suicide vests. The terror attack left 79 people dead. After surviving that atrocity, it would have been understandable if Eagles of Death Metal had decided to quit. Instead they have thrown themselves back into playing. After appearing as guests of U2 in Paris within a month of the attack, the Californian garage-rockers returned to life on the road in February and have barely stopped since, clocking up almost 70 gigs and festival appearances on their Nos Amis (“Our Friends”) tour. There have been speed bumps. Hughes, a gun enthusiast who has long cultivated an outlaw image, has made several inflammatory remarks in interviews. His claim in May that he had seen Muslims celebrating in the streets after the Paris attacks were provocative enough that his band were removed from the bill of two French music festivals taking place this weekend. (Instead, Eagles of Death Metal will play Reading and Leeds.) At their first UK show since the attack, the band take the stage to the unlikely stomp of Shang-a-Lang by the Bay City Rollers. They’re cheered loudly and at length, the sort of reaction usually heard at the end of a triumphant gig rather than before the band have played a single note. It allows Hughes to ritually undo perhaps one too many buttons on his shirt and carefully primp his bushy Doc Holliday moustache. In a scuzzy 90-minute set of raucous, ratbag rock, the Bataclan experience is referenced only obliquely. It remains unclear whether the Eagles of Death Metal gig was targeted because the band were from the US; for his part, Hughes seems happy to symbolise his country. During the rattling two-chord boogie of I Only Want You, large banners unfurl to reveal Uncle Sam’s iconic recruiting posters recreated with Hughes’s likeness. You could arguably read something into their plangent reading of Save a Prayer, but the Duran Duran cover was a mainstay of their set before last November. There are no lengthy sermons, despite Hughes’s habit of hollering like an impassioned tent preacher. Instead, there is exhilarating rock burlesque. Hughes vamps. He struts. He repurposes jokes from Airplane. He pulls on a bright red jacket with “Bowie” embroidered on the back before the band play a roughed-up but rather beautiful version of Moonage Daydream. The closest acknowledgement of their horrific experience comes near the end. “It’s been a strange fucking year and I am so grateful,” says Hughes. His ramshackle band represent the right to make preening, priapic, occasionally obnoxious rock’n’roll, a sentiment that goes over well with the exultant crowd, who radiate a protective positivity. Before a last splurge of excessive guitar solos, Hughes offers one final piece of advice: “Stay horny!”\n",
      "Matt Damon and Ben Affleck surprise fans with Good Will Hunting reading Matt Damon and Ben Affleck reprised the roles that made them famous onstage in New York on Friday night, with a surprise appearance in a one-off live reading of the screenplay of Good Will Hunting. The childhood friends were almost unknown when they wrote and insisted on starring in the tale of a young working-class polymath who is mopping floors at MIT when his life is turned around by a therapist, played by Robin Williams, and a Harvard student, played by Minnie Driver. It won the two an Oscar for best screenplay, was nominated for eight more (Williams also won), and provided them with a route to the big time. Today, they occupy numbers three (Damon) and six (Affleck) on the 2016 Forbes list of the world’s highest-paid male actors. John Krasinski reunited the pair on Friday as part of a Film Independent and New York Times series of “live reads”, in which actors read the screenplay of a film to a live audience. The cast list was not released in advance, allowing Krasinski a moment of pure showmanship before the reading began. Introducing his cast one by one – including his wife, Emily Blunt, in the Driver role – Krasinski finally came to the leads, announcing that he himself would be playing Will … before Damon unexpectedly marched on to the stage, to a standing ovation from the crowd at New York University’s Skirball theatre. “Thirty seconds before that, you were happy to see me do it!” Krasinski said. Preparing to sit down and take Affleck’s part instead, he said: “Chuckie’s a better role anyway …” On cue, the Batman star followed Damon out from the wings, bringing the delighted audience leaping back to their feet. The 1997 screenplay has held up well, and is often laugh-out-loud funny, much of its charm resting on the witty, wisecracking, believable banter between the dumb but protective Chuckie and his best friend, the brilliant, defensive and confrontational Will. Affleck and Damon slid easily back into characters based presumably on young men they had known or witnessed growing up in Boston, and Affleck in particular – now bearded, tanned and heavy-set – seemed to take great delight in revisiting the ribald put-downs and convoluted anecdotes which pepper the script. Damon, whose DiCaprio-like quicksilver charisma has become something more stolid and workmanlike, was able to recapture that early magnetism. He was devastating in that indelible scene in which he tells Williams that when his father used to give him a choice of wrench, belt or stick for a beating, he would always choose the wrench – “because fuck him, that’s why”. Blunt approached the part of Damon’s student girlfriend with something of the English naturalism that Driver brought to the film in 1997, and Krasinski, who read the stage directions, stumbled for comic effect over some of her love scenes with Damon, altering the ending of one to: “They do not kiss,” tripping over the word “postcoital” in another. “It was really good!” his wife blurted out, to which Krasinski asked rhetorically: “You’re really going to take Jason Bourne over Jim from The Office?” Less successful was his casting of The Americans’ Margo Martindale in the crucial Williams role. The gender switch might well have worked, but she was hesitant and seemed under-rehearsed. Introducing the event, Krasinski made the case for Good Will Hunting as a modern American classic. “As a kid from Boston, I think we all get tattoos of the poster of this movie on your back,” he said, calling it “unbelievably well-written”. In truth, Affleck and Damon lay it on a bit thick in establishing Will’s genius – what is meant to come off as autodidactic brilliance occasionally teeters over into insufferability – and it’s a more sentimental film than it thinks it is, emotionally manipulative in a way that seems mercilessly machine-tooled for maximum effect, particularly towards the end. But it works. And looking back, it laid the groundwork for Affleck’s career as a director producing compelling thrillers such as Argo and The Town that use tension as shamelessly as Good Will Hunting uses emotion, pleasingly calling to mind the crime dramas of the 1940s and 50s in which taciturn men find themselves forced into intractable situations, weighing up dilemmas about love and corruption and morality. Which, come to think of it, doesn’t sound a bad template for the Batman film Affleck is currently writing.\n",

      "Sam Beam and Jesca Hoop review – Americana's golden duo make sweet music together Sam Beam and Jesca Hoop are so clearly made for each other that they should consider making this professional pairing permanent. The former, who trades as the folk-lounge-Americana outfit Iron and Wine, and the eclectic Californian songwriter Hoop are like a pair of unrelated siblings: their delicate golden harmonies are as instinctive as their genial bickering. Visually, they’re also cut from the same rawboned cloth, he bearded and brimstoneish, she full-skirted and ramrod-spined. Their collaborative album, Love Letter for Fire, played almost in full here, harvests the best of both. Notwithstanding their individual dabblings in hip-hop and funk, as a duo they gravitate to backwoods folk with country accents. Both play guitar, with Hoop the more adventurous player as Beam chunks out the rhythms. From the opening Kiss Me Quick, their vocals puddle mellifluously, often reducing lyrics to a blur. Ironically, it’s hard to discern a word these exceptionally wordy writers are singing. No matter. The autumnal flow of We Two Are a Moon – the first song they wrote as a team – sounds like a more authentic Civil Wars, while solo songs such as Iron and Wine’s Resurrection Fern and Hoop’s Hunting My Dress entice an unexpected earthiness out of Hoop and silvery delicacy from Beam. If anything is lacking, it’s drama: the set ambles along at the same gentle pace throughout, broken only by a wonderfully odd cover of the Parton/Rogers hit Islands in the Stream. Gummed up and creaking, it’s a welcome palate-cleanser during this four-course soft-folk meal. •At End of the Road festival, Salisbury, on 3 September, and Moseley folk festival, Birmingham, on 4 September.\n",
      "Iggy Pop – 10 of the best 1. Kill City (with James Williamson) The Stooges had come off the rails before, but in February 1974 they finally split for good. Despite the ignominious nature of their demise, Jim Osterberg – the man behind Iggy Pop – had still not quite reached his rock bottom. He spent the best part of a year couch surfing and relying on the charity of others, including fans, for heroin and quaaludes. An intervention took place when he was arrested for intimidating diners at an LA burger emporium. Detention at a psychiatric facility on the UCLA campus gave the singer time to cool off, and at the weekends he was allowed out to record with former Stooges guitarist James Williamson at Jimmy Webb’s home studio in Encino. Kill City is an edgy and erratic blur of driving riffage in the style of the old band, with Pop grumbling about surviving in the city, “until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees”. Record companies passed on the 1975 Kill City demos, at least until 1977, when Iggy Pop’s stock was on the rise again, and Bomp! Records gave Williamson funds to complete and release the album. 2. Nightclubbing Despite their narcotic proclivities, David Bowie and Iggy Pop were good for each other. Their counterintuitive logic led them to try to clean up their lifestyles by moving from LA to Berlin, the heroin capital of the world, but they showed a surprising degree of restraint while living there (for a while anyway). The 18 months they spent together would turn out to be the most productive period of both their lives. Iggy managed to release two albums in 1977, the first of which – The Idiot, named after the Dostoevsky novel – was a far cry from the Stooges. Minimalist, electronic and experimental, it was recorded at the famous Château d’Hérouville in Val d’Oise, before being finished off in Munich and Berlin. The recording techniques of the pair were said to be unorthodox and eccentric. In his Iggy biography Open Up and Bleed, Paul Trynka writes that drummer Michel Santangeli was packed off back to Brittany before he’d even realised they’d started recording, while guitarist Phil Palmer was asked to imagine and replicate the sounds one might encounter walking past the clubs of Wardour Street. Nightclubbing throbs with the sleazy ambience of an underground Kreuzberg club, though with the persistent disco thud slowed down to create the kind of disorientating effect one might experience while heavily sedated. “We recorded the song with a lousy drum machine,” Pop recalled later. “Bowie kept saying, ‘But we gotta call back the drummer, you’re not gonna have that freaky sound on the tape!’ And I replied, ‘Hey, no way, it kicks ass, it’s better than a drummer.’” 3. Funtime Funtime followed the Stooges’ Fun House and No Fun; in fact it was the Sex Pistols’ cover of the latter (which eventually soundtracked their messy unravelling at the Winterland Ballroom) that first inspired Iggy to revisit the familiar motif. It’s written, unusually, in the first person plural (“Hey baby we like your lips / Hey baby we like your pants”), and Bowie’s backing vocal attacks high in the mix, with both voices offering confrontation. In fact, it’s a deadpan and almost threatening delivery that juxtaposes the devil-may-care lyrics, making it all the more sinister and disconcerting. Based on the pair’s partying experiences in LA, the mechanical tenacity of the backing track and the dehumanised singing represent repeatedly going through the motions when all the fun has dried up. 4. Lust for Life The unlikely musical germ of an idea for Lust For Life came when Bowie attempted to imitate the Armed Forces Network call signal with his ukulele (he was apparently waiting for Starsky and Hutch to come on the television in Germany). The Armed Forces Network “was one of the few things that was in English on the telly”, said Bowie, “and it had this great pulsating riff at the beginning of the news”. The insistent beat was reinforced by drummer Hunt Sales and his brother Tony on bass, while guitarist Carlos Alomar said its driving rhythm was so dominating that to play something on the offbeat was out of the question. Iggy Pop then improvised the lyrics, alluding to the clean regime he and Bowie were trying to observe (“No more beating my brains with the liquor and drugs”), while the “that’s like hypnotising chickens” line comes straight from the character Johnny Yen in William Buroughs’ novel The Ticket That Exploded. The song got a boost in the 90s when it was prominently used in the film Trainspotting, and thanks to that exposure, it now rivals The Passenger as Pop’s best-known song. Lust For Life is also the title track of the first album written and conceived entirely in Berlin for both Iggy and Bowie. “The wall was beautiful,” said the former. “It created a wonderful island, the same way that volcanos created islands in the sea. The opposing pressures created this place that they all studiously [ignored] and nobody bugged you. It was wonderful.” The album should have sold more in 1977, but Elvis Presley’s unexpected death coincided with Iggy’s own release schedule, meaning all of RCA’s resources were used up reprinting the King’s back catalogue. 5. I’m Bored Iggy’s third solo album proper, New Values, was the first not to feature Bowie, with James Williamson back as producer. New Values is a wildly creative and commercially undervalued tour de force of songwriting that suffers only slightly from Williamson’s dry and unostentatious production. That doesn’t impede I’m Bored, a song that actually thrives on its threadbare garage simplicity. Pop bellyaches with a deep boom about the ennui he feels, while gently lampooning the captains of industry driving the economy – “I’m bored / I’m the chairman of the bored”. As a champion of the hoi polloi, Pop often had a pop at the establishment, though I’m Bored was far more subtly subversive than I’m a Conservative on the following album. Such nihilism was in keeping with the musical climate, though Iggy had been expressing his dissatisfaction long before it was fashionable to do so. 6. I Need More Iggy had recruited Rich Kids bass guitarist and ex-Sex Pistol Glen Matlock for the New Values tour. Matlock stuck around for the following album, Soldier, writing one track and co-writing another three (although he soon left again after an altercation over the final mix). The pick of the bunch is I Need More. “More venom, more dynamite, more disaster,” spits Pop, “I need more than I ever did before.” According to Trynka, the song is an exploration of Pop’s narcissism, which was partly inspired by his time in that psychiatric institution. Intriguingly, Murray Zucker, the doctor who treated him in 1975, has said the hypomania he diagnosed might have been a misdiagnosis, adding that I Need More is a “brilliant exploration” of narcissism as a condition. It’s a rough and ready, picaresque adventure into Ig’s id, while musically the song swings with a menace that’s oddly reminiscent of the Fall. 7. Repo Man In the early 80s, Iggy was struck by hard luck, tax demands and artistic underperformance, but much of his misfortune could be attributed to a tendency to self-sabotage. Record contracts came and went, and musically he lost his way as he persisted in beating his brains, winding up paying another visit to Dr Zucker in 1983. The British movie director Alex Cox found him in an unfurnished studio off Sunset Strip and gave him carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with the theme to Repo Man. “At the time, I’d had a hiccup in my career due to my wild lifestyle,” said Iggy. “I was sort of on the ropes, not making much money … It was like a gift from God to express myself.” Joining forces with ex-Sex Pistol Steve Jones, who was now clean, as well as members of Blondie, Iggy delivered another biting indictment of LA living, which begins with the lines: “I was riding on a concrete slab, down a river of useless flab / it was such a beautiful day / I heard a witchdoctor say, ‘I’ll turn you into a toadstool.’” Repo Man – the song – is a stream-of-consciousness masterclass conceived and recorded in 20 minutes flat. It’s one of Iggy’s indisputable highlights of the decade, though to be fair, there weren’t too many of those. 8. Shades “There’s a fine line between entertaining flamboyance and being a prat,” said the newly self-aware singer. “I was becoming Don Quixote.” His getting clean and sober also coincided with reconvening his artistic relationship with David Bowie. Again Bowie was there at his lowest ebb with the promise of redemption, and 1986 saw Pop’s profile rise again. There were even hits, notably a cover of Johnny O’Keefe’s The Wild One, renamed Real Wild Child, which went Top 10 in the UK. The resulting album, Blah Blah Blah, certainly sounds like a product of its time, but some of the songs cut through the fluorescent sheen, especially Shades, which is a much better David Bowie song than the ones he was writing for himself at the time. It’s a dizzyingly romantic love song that Iggy carries off with surprising aplomb. “I’m not the kind of guy who dresses like a king / And a really fine pair of shades means everything,” he sings, enamoured with his new present from his sweetheart. “And the light that blinds my eyes shines from you.” 9. Wild America It may surprise some that Iggy Pop’s best selling album to date is 1990’s Brick by Brick, mainly thanks to his first US top 40 hit, Candy, a duet with the B52s’ Kate Pierson. The album was poor, and at times, puerile; the follow-up, American Caesar, was vastly superior, but sold nothing like its predecessor. In fact the 90s is generally regarded as another fallow period for Pop, the nadir coming in the shape of 1996’s dreadful Naughty Little Doggie, but American Caesar is blessed with some truly fine moments, like a song that documents a night out in the US Iggy Pop style. “Now I’m in a black car with my Mexicana / She’s got methedrine but I want marijuana,” he drawls, and the morning after is recounted too: “She laughed and said Iggy / You have got a biggy.” Wild America features a scything, repetitive guitar line, while the video cuts to autobiographical footage of a shirtless Jim Osterberg recounting growing up in a Michigan trailer park. 10. Paraguay Iggy Pop’s career is strewn with some fairly indifferent collaborations, but when he gets it right, true alchemy happens. Bowie is the most obvious example of a perfect partner (80s French new wave duo Les Rita Mitsouko are probably less obvious), and then there’s Josh Homme, who has helped resurrect Iggy’s solo career. It all happened thanks to Pop reaching out to the musician by text message, suggesting they might try writing together. Subsequently Pop said Homme took him to “a place I’d never been,” while Homme added it was a place “neither of us had gone before. That was the agreement. And to go all the way.” This year’s album Post Pop Depression is a masterwork by the 69-year-old that may yet prove to be his last. If so then it’s a profound and stylish way to conclude an illustrious career. Every song is a contender, but Paraguay gets the nod because of its sheer ambition. During the clattering, blues-driven outro, Iggy dreams of “getting away to a new life / Where there’s not so much fucking knowledge / I don’t want any of this ‘information’.” Right to the last, there’s an internal struggle and the desire to get away, though at least this time its for new climes rather than disappearing into a deleterious hole (Paraguay may well symbolise a spiritually higher plane). Those that know the singer well often talk of a duality, of the charming James Newell Osterberg versus the monster Iggy Pop. Iggy might appear to be a loser at times, but with a legendary career spanning more than half a century behind him, one can only beg to differ.\n",
      "Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift: match made in heaven or a PR stunt? Hiddleswift. It sounds like some arcane practice out of JK Rowling but it is, of course, the latest celebrity hybrid that takes its place alongside those other magnificent centaurs, Brangelina, Bennifer and Kimye. Names that are – in ways that would require a PhD in marketing to explain – so much more than the sum of their parts. Ever since that fateful day, only last Thursday, when the Sun revealed its “world exclusive” with the deathless headline “Tinker Taylor Snogs a Spy”, the world has been coming to terms with the apparent merger of two leading glamour brands: the actor Tom Hiddleston and the singer-songwriter Taylor Swift Photographs showed the alleged couple kissing and canoodling on some rocks on a beach in Rhode Island. Exactly how and why the photographs were taken remains the subject of fevered speculation. Some suggest that they are not authentic paparazzi work, insofar as they lack that hallmark sense of furtive intrusion. The word that has been used is “staged”. That a fledgling romance between two such talented luminaries in distinct fields of the arts could be reduced to so crude an epithet is perhaps a reflection of the cynical times in which we live. That said, the images do indeed look as if a team of PR consultants and fashion stylists had just stepped out of the shot, rather than as though they were captured by lucky lurking snapper. Which raises the question: why would a singer whose private life forms the basis of her songwriting and is the source of intense interest for her army of fans and a man widely judged to be waging an unprecedentedly aggressive campaign to become the next James Bond want to place themselves in a situation that gained global exposure? Who knows? Forget the photos and enjoy the story, which comes with such a strong aroma of invention that it can only be true. It seems that they met last month at the Met Gala in New York, where Swift challenged Hiddleston to a dance. Among his many gifts – a passable Robert De Niro impression and a winningly bashful smile – Hiddleston, as YouTube will confirm, is a seriously good dancer. And if it should turn out that buried in the works of Ian Fleming is a scene in which Bond struts his funky stuff, then the job’s in the bag. Anyway, they danced, chatted and he called her the moment he heard that Swift had broken up from her boyfriend, the Scottish DJ Calvin Harris. Anonymous sources – and this tale features more anonymous sources than a Seymour Hersh exposé – say that he sent her flowers and deployed that bashful smile – so lethal in The Night Manager that it completely disarmed an arms dealer – to devastating effect. Or perhaps not. No one official is saying. Even the PRs are withholding a clarifying statement. All that leaves for the watching world are the enigmatic clues left on social media. Harris has unfollowed Swift and composed a (since deleted) gnomic tweet: “Oh boy it’s about to go down”. That may have referred to his next gig, but the consensus of opinion is that it means they are never ever getting back together. If love has always been cruel, in the age of 24-hour status updates it can be particularly unforgiving. But then Swift, still only 26, has never been one for keeping her emotions to herself. As Rolling Stone said, she overshares “louder than anyone else in the game”. Her deceptively catchy brand of country-pop is shot through with the bittersweet memories of her various relationships with, among others, Jake Gyllenhaal, One Direction’s Harry Styles and Robert F Kennedy’s grandson, Conor. She is an uncannily gifted songwriter, able to infuse irresistible riffs with surprisingly poignant lyrics. Her album 1989 – the year of her birth – has been hailed as a pop classic. She is hugely successful, rivalled only by Adele on the international stage, and said to be worth in the neighbourhood of $200m. It says something about the elusive nature of sexual equality that a young, powerful, rich, attractive and extremely famous woman still represents a problematic equation. History, even more enlightened recent history, is not overendowed with men who are comfortable with taking a lesser position in the spotlight. But say what you will about old Etonians, they tend not to suffer from a shortfall in confidence. And one of Hiddleston’s strongest suits is his easy physical charm. “He has an exceptional sense of rhythm and moves like a dream,” the director Joanna Hogg has said. And he looks not only smart enough to recognise the great good fortune that life has brought him, but also to enjoy it. As he told an interviewer a couple of years ago when his career was starting to take off, with major parts in Steven Spielberg’s War Horse adaptation and the Marvel Comics’ Thor series: “It’s mad and bananas and amazing. But I can handle it for the simple reason that it genuinely feels like it’s not real. You know when you go to a fancy dress party and everyone looks incredible and there are crazy things hanging from the ceiling? For about five hours or so, you enter into another world and then, when you come out of it, you are sitting at home with a cup of tea and a biscuit and you’re thinking to yourself, ‘Well, that was weird. Fun, but weird.’ That’s exactly what it feels like.” The suffering artist he is not. Having grown up in Oxford, attended the Dragon School, Eton and then Cambridge, where he gained a double first in classics, there is little argument that he has had a privileged start in life. His father was a self-made man from a working-class background in Glasgow who wanted to give his children a leg-up. His parents split up when he was 13 and had just started Eton, an experience of which he said: “I like to think it made me more compassionate in my understanding of human frailty.” As a consequence, he has often been cast in film and television roles as a handsome young man condemned to accept a blessed existence. In this, he has never been better than in his very first film role in Joanna Hogg’s excellent Unrelated, playing the object of a middle-aged woman’s thwarted desires. There is a boyish but unruffled quality about him that some critics have construed as complacency. Although The Night Manager – the most expensive audition for the Bond part ever filmed – was a success, it was said that Hiddleston didn’t do much. But it’s fair to say that his main responsibility was looking captivating to both the male and female characters alike and he managed this with aplomb. However, if the photos, and the subsequent ones of the couple getting on Swift’s private jet, are true (even if staged), then Hiddleston is going to come under the kind of scrutiny that will test his refined unflappability to the very limit. Swift, who likes to surround herself with a posse of famous friends (Lena Dunham, Cara Delevingne, Ellie Goulding), is used to the attention. She was declared a prodigy in the New Yorker when she was just 16. Taught to play guitar by a computer repairman when she was 12, she showed such promise that her parents relocated the family to Nashville when she was 14. By the time she was 18, her second album, Fearless, was a multimillion bestseller. She is nine years younger than Hiddleston, but she has been in show-business as long as he has and she has within her a resilience that belies her tender years. The press has written in detail about all her relationships, but then so has she, the difference being that she doesn’t name names. As she has said: “The fact that I’ve never confirmed whom those songs are about makes me feel there is still one card I’m holding.” She hates the idea that she has been “calculating” about her private life, using it to increase her public reach. “You can be accidentally successful for three or four years,” she told one interviewer who raised the issue. “Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.” As do relationships, especially in the glare of carefully arranged paparazzi cameras. Perhaps Hiddleswift will handle it with the ironic understanding that it’s not real but mad and bananas and amazing and it’s all just weird fun. But if they don’t, well at least they make a pretty – if not entirely convincing – picture. THE HIDDLESTON AND SWIFT FILE Born Taylor Alison Swift, Reading, Pennsylvania, 13 December 1989; Thomas William Hiddleston, London, 9 February 1981. Best of times Swift’s fifth album, 1989, released in 2014 sold more copies in its opening week than any album in the previous 12 years. It also won three Grammy awards. Hiddleston’s title role in BBC1’s hit spy thriller The Night Manager was a huge hit with critics and TV audiences. He’s favourite to be the new James Bond. Worst of times When Kanye West ruined Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV VMA awards, telling the audience that Beyoncé should have won. Hiddleston starred in a 2014 Jaguar commercial criticised for encouraging irresponsible driving. She says “I went out on a normal amount of dates in my early 20s and I got absolutely slaughtered for it. I didn’t date for two-and-a-half years. Should I have had to do that? No.” He says “You can’t treat the woman you love as a piece of meat. You should treat your love like a princess. Give her love songs, something with real meaning.”\n",
      "Roger Daltrey planning solo record and book – but he may not release them In October the Who’s Roger Daltrey will appear at the star-studded Desert Trip festival in California. Now he’s adding two projects to his calendar: a solo album and an autobiography – both of which, he says, may never see the light of day. “I’m working on a solo project, but I don’t know whether I’ll ever release it,” Daltrey said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I’m working on a biography … [but] I’ll only release it if it’s a good book. I don’t care how long it takes. “I won’t sign a publishing deal. People sign a publishing deal and they have to put it out because they’ve taken the money. Well, bollocks to the money, I don’t care about the money. I want [to write] a good book.” He also expressed concern about the way in which people consume music for free online: “The way the internet has come about has been the biggest robbery in history,” he said, “like musicians should work for nothing.” When asked about whether the Who would put out any of its unreleased songs, he said he wouldn’t pay-to-play. “There’s no royalties, so I can’t see that ever happening. There’s no record business. How do you get the money to make the records? … I’m certainly not going to pay money to give my music away for free. I can’t afford to do that. I’ve got other things I could waste the money on,” Daltrey said. “Musicians are getting robbed every day,” he added. “You notice, the internet is a slowly but surely destructive thing. I don’t think it’s improved people’s lives. It’s just made them do more work and feel like they’re wanted a bit more, but it’s all bollocks.” A new solo record would be Daltrey’s first lone venture since 1992’s Rocks in the Head. The Who frontman has released eight solo studio albums so far, kicking off in 1973 with Daltrey. He says he has collected “five great tracks” for a proposed solo record, and is “looking for another five”. What musical direction might he take? “I started off as a soul singer. I’ve never done a soul album. I’m playing some stuff like that. I’ve got ranges in my voice that people have never, ever heard.”\n",
      "Cult heroes: Amanda Palmer – a fearless one-woman creative typhoon Times and places are fuzzy. Some anonymous arena, around 2004. I can’t even remember which band I was there to review – something a bit goth, I suspect. But the pre-gig video is fried forever on to my internal Imax like a nuclear shadow, in all its surreal, expressionist cabaret glory. A woman dressed like a Weimar-era debutante mime – face pan-stick white, curlicues for eyebrows, the striped stockings of a Brechtian sex doll – slammed the window on a stream of human suitors and cuddled up instead to a clockwork boyfriend. “I turn him on and he comes to life,” she cooed, animating her robotic beau by dropping a silver penny into a slot on his chest, “automatic joy … many shapes and weights to choose from / I will never leave my bedroom / I will never cry at night again / wrap my arms around him and pretend.” By the end of the clip she’d graduated from forcing her plastic man-toy to waltz along to her entrancing music-box melody to hammering at a piano and bawling like a horror movie banshee crying out for her long-dead baby. It even came with a postmodern cry for help in the bridge, “written to make you feel smittener / with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer / Can you extract me from my plastic fantasy?” The song was Coin-Operated Boy, the band was the Dresden Dolls and the woman was Amanda Palmer. And I wasn’t the first, or the last, person dumbstruck by her. Occasionally known as Amanda Fucking Palmer, she first emerged as a leading agent provocateur of the Boston street-theatre scene. Between directing surreal Nazi-themed performance art pieces based on the music of the Legendary Pink Dots and touring the world’s tourist plazas with her Eight Foot Bride living statue act, she developed a cult following with the Dresden Dolls, the “Brechtian punk cabaret” band she formed with drummer Brian Viglione in 2000. Inviting fans to fire-breathe, stilt-walk and generally burlesque it up at their early shows, they grew a wing called the Dirty Business Brigade to co-ordinate the performers and became a keystone of the burgeoning dark cabaret movement, a parade of theatrical freaks, mimes and Moriartys. The Dresden Dolls lived out the dream of every university drama troupe that’s ever bagged free Glastonbury tickets in return for parading across the theatre fields dressed as escapees from a vaudevillian drumming workshop, but it worked because of Palmer’s innate talent, tortured demeanour and contemporary nous. Lesser artists might have defined themselves by the am dram theatrics or played it as Dita Von Teese with attitude, but Palmer dug deep into her squirming sack of issues and let her songwriting skills speak for themselves. Their debut album certainly contained enough cabaret overtones to warrant its own woodland stage in Bestival’s ambient forest, but Palmer’s savvy piano punk construction of Girl Anachronism, Coin-Operated Boy and Bad Habit was blessed with a post-millennial pop edge and her lyrics struck a chord with the damaged emo era. In interview she spoke of abortion, bisexuality, open relationships, date rape and a past as a stripper called Berlin; on record she seemed constantly on the edge of screaming emotional meltdown, tackling thorny taboos such as self-harm, romantic delirium, paedophilia and psychiatric medication in brutally frank terms. Missed Me’s portrayal of a young girl’s thought processes while being groomed for abuse was particularly disturbing: “If you kiss me mister you must think I’m pretty / If you think so mister you must want to fuck me / If you fuck me mister it must mean you love me.” Difficult pills indeed, only made palatable by the fourth wall of Palmer’s melodramatic persona and the gallows humour of the unbroken survivor. Witness her skewering an uncaring ex from behind a fake mask of indifference on first single Good Day, years before we all perfected the “look how much fun I’m having without you” Facebook album. Like other artists using their music as an open diary of tangible anguish, Palmer grew a devoted following, sucked into her expanding web of artistry. Rather than let her success in music constrain her, she remained a theatrical and poetic polymath, writing books that accompanied the Dresden Dolls albums, and encouraged and collaborating with fans on two 2006 musicals of their work: A Clockwork Waltz and The Onion Cellar. Their gigs became carnivals or nights of “celluloid vaudeville”, featuring short films made by fans and friends, local artist performances and Palmer playing impromptu solo shows of film soundtrack covers. The result was a fan community that felt intrinsically involved in her beautiful dark twisted fantasy, and deeply defensive of their hardy heroine. When Palmer blogged that her label, Roadrunner, had tried to insist that she remove shots of her “uncommercially fat” stomach from the video of a song called Leeds United from her 2008 Ben Folds-produced solo debut, Who Killed Amanda Palmer – a song, obviously, about losing a football shirt given to her by Ricky Wilson – a fan “reBELLYon” struck up online. Fans sent pictures of their stomachs to Roadrunner in their droves, eventually helping Palmer achieve her goal of being released from her contract. The album’s other videos, featuring Palmer stripped bare on Ampersand or caught mid-breakdown on Runs in the Family, received overwhelming support in the 24-hour Troll Power rally that is the YouTube comments section. When she launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her second solo album, Theatre Is Evil, in 2012, her modest target was smashed as thoroughly as all of her bedroom mirrors. The grand total of $1.2m was the most raised by a musician at the time. In return, Palmer leaves nothing about her life and music out of bounds. On the tour for Theatre Is Evil, she invited fans to join her Grand Theft Orchestra backing band on horns and strings for a few songs, only to run into criticism from the likes of Steve Albini for not paying them out of her Kickstarter windfall. She’s regularly played all-ages guerilla gigs on the ukulele, covering the likes of Neutral Milk Hotel, NWA, Radiohead (she released an entire covers album of Radiohead songs) and, oh yes, Rebecca Black’s Friday. Sometimes, she stripped naked to let hordes of fans write and draw on her. The Daily Mail was playing with fire when it tried to turn her into faux-shock tabloid titillation in the wake of a “nip slip” at Glastonbury 2013; she responded by performing a song called Dear Daily Mail, Up Yours in the nude at London’s Roundhouse. Bold, brazen, inclusive and flamboyantly political – this is the woman who kissed, gagged, kidnapped and mock-married a Katy Perry impersonator onstage in 2008 to protest Proposition 8 – Palmer is a one-woman creative typhoon, gathering disciples and import wherever she spins. In a pop landscape full of contrived shock and ghostwritten soul-baring, Palmer’s the real deal.\n",
      "Neil Young and Promise of the Real review – rocking down the nature trail After recent dalliances with combusting custom converted electric cars and less than highly praised high-fidelity music players, Neil Young is back on firmer and more familiar ground with his anti-agribusiness concept album The Monsanto Years. “Look at Mother Nature on the run, in the 21st century,” sings the grizzled dude hunched over a beat-up old upright piano in a black fedora hat and T-shirt emblazoned “EARTH”, as he contemporises a lyric from 1970’s still miraculous sounding After the Gold Rush to roars of approval from the crowd. (The line “I felt like getting high” also gets its own telling ovation.) The 70-year-old Canadian folk, country and rock icon was writing about the embattled natural world long before most people had even heard of their carbon footprint. In an atypically theatrical start to proceedings, two men dressed like poor farm hands scatter seeds across the stage, ahead of a lassoing opening solo acoustic segment that includes Heart of Gold, still powerful anti-heroin anthem The Needle and the Damage Done and, performed on a wheezing church organ, Mother Earth (Natural Anthem). After a time, as the young bucks from Promise of the Real emerge – Young’s latest backing group and collaborators, a five-piece Californian jam band featuring Willie Nelson’s sons Lukas and Micah (the former rocks a kilt) – men in hazmat suits pretend-spray pesticides about their feet. GM foods, corporate greed and America’s busted rural economy are clearly on Young’s mind at the moment, although strangely he largely eschews songs from The Monsanto Years, save for the inclusion towards the end of weary country love song to a wounded planet Wolf Moon, and the record’s supermarkets-spearing title track. (Its low choral drawls of “at Saaaafeway” sound like the most dissuasive advertising jingle ever penned.) But no matter, considering the diverse and career-spanning array of songwriting riches otherwise disbursed over two-and-half hours. They’re arranged roughly on an increasing scale of heaviosity, from the harmonica-licked rootsy likes of Out on the Weekend and Unknown Legend through to a handful of Crazy Horse numbers starting with a sludgy-rousing Down By the River that lasts nearly 20 minutes by the time its droning strains finally fade. Promise of the Real prove very able accomplices, whether hitting levitational multi-part chorus harmonies, or clustering around their esteemed patron for a feedback-whacked guitar solos tossing wig-out. Enjoyment of the show’s final act is substantially contingent on an appreciation of protracted instrumentals, but whether you’re a fan of long-form cosmic gnarl or not, you’ve got to agree that nobody does it quite like Young. Come a 15-minute Love and Only Love he’s lost in his own fretboard in front of 13,000 people, deafeningly coaxing out the final chord longer than entire songs had lasted in the show’s opening phase. After that it’s approving dad hugs all round for the band, and a short time later, a curfew-busting encore of Fuckin’ Up – a tractor-strength reminder why every generation that values howling riffs and angry dissent will find inspiration in Young’s evergreen natural anthems. • Neil Young and Promise of the Real play SSE Arena, Belfast (028 9073 9074) 7 June; First Direct Arena, Leeds (0844 248 1585), 10 June; O2 Arena, London (0844 856 0202), 11 June.\n",
      "'She seemed shy. Then suddenly this wild beast came out' – my 10 years shooting Kate Bush “Any other star,” says Guido Harari, “would have gone crazy. They’d have probably thrown me out.” It was 1am one night in 1989 and the Italian had been photographing Kate Bush non-stop for 15 hours. “We hadn’t eaten. We weren’t really talking. Just shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot.” You worked in silence? “Yes. It was like we had telepathic communication.” Bush had asked Harari to do the official photo shoot for her new album The Sensual World. And then, in the early hours, Harari had a bright idea. “I thought she looked like the figurehead of a ship. So I would make her look as though she was swimming towards the camera underwater.” Harari decided to create this image by shooting Bush in a Romeo Gigli dress in front of a rented painted backdrop that looked like a Pollock painting. Then he would ask her to step out of the shot, rewind the film on his Hasselblad camera and shoot the backdrop again, making it look like she was a swimming through a submarine world of drips and blobs. And then he had another idea. Why not have two images of Kate Bush on the same frame? “And then I thought: why only two Kates? Why not three Kates – all swimming in the water? She had to stand really still so she wouldn’t go out of focus because I was using a wide aperture, so there was no depth of field. She had to walk out of the shot, then back in, stand very still, and do the same again. I knew it was going to be great but it was going to take time and patience – and you don’t get either often from famous people when you’re photographing them.” Isn’t that when her PR minder should have intervened and said: Guido, enough already? “Well yes! But there was no minder. She was never part of what she called the machine.” As we chat, Harari shows me shots from his new book The Kate Inside, which documents his 10 years photographing the British pop star. It shows her wearing a T-shirt that says: I am a prima donna. “My God,” he says. “I’ve worked with some real prima donnas, not to mention any names. She wasn’t one of them.” Indeed, there is a copy of her handwritten thank you note which says: “You’ve made me look great.” Harari has made his name over the years with disarmingly odd images of musicians. Leonard Cohen asleep on a little table before a huge painting; Tom Waits strutting in an improbably voluminous cape; Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed in a moment of tenderness, her nuzzling nose disappearing into his open shirt. Harari was a Kate Bush fan from the first time he heard her first single, Wuthering Heights, on the radio in 1978. “She was a pioneer, especially in Britain where no solo female artist had had a number one-selling album until she came along. And you had the sense that, despite her wistful manner, she had balls of steel.” The photographer first met her in 1982 in Milan, when she was promoting her album The Dreaming. In the book he describes his first impressions:“Beautiful golden eyes, pouty lips, a big mane of hennaed hair.” Bush and her dancers had just come from a TV studio. “She was wearing what looked like decaying astronaut gear,” he recalls. “I had my equipment with me, so I asked them to improvise. What amazed me was how she switched. She seemed to be this shy girl then suddenly this wild beast came out. ” In Milan, Harari showed her proofs for a new book he was making aboutLindsay Kemp. The choreographer had trained the teenage Kate Bush in the mid-1970s, becoming a mentor to her, as he had been for David Bowie. “So my book was like a calling card – showing her that I understood where she was coming from artistically.” Three years later, Bush called, asking if he would do the official shoot for her album Hounds of Love. “I went to meet her at her parents’ farmhouse in Kent. She had built a 48-track studio. One thing that really struck me was that there was no glass between the control room and where the musicians recorded. It was a place of silence and retreat from the rock’n’roll world. She had no desire to go to parties or be famous. Instead, she had her family around her. Her father was her manager and her brother had taken photos for her previous albums.” For the Hounds of Love shoot, Bush told Harari that she would bring clothes that would be brown, blue and gold. “Nothing else! No other clues! So I got some backdrops I thought would go with those colours, and at 8am she turned up at the studio with her makeup woman and a few outfits and we went to work.” Most of the photographs in Harari’s book have never been seen before. “There are lots of outtakes. What would happen is, at the end of the day, I’d have hundreds of rolls of film which I’d edit and then send to Kate. She’d send, say, four images to the record company. What nobody has seen until now is the progress through the day’s shoot. They really give a sense of her. The way she’s goofy one minute and then posing the next.” After doing the photography for Hounds of Love and The Sensual World, in 1993 Harari was asked to be the stills photographer for her 50-minute film The Line, The Cross and the Curve starring Miranda Richardson, Lindsay Kemp and Bush, and showcasing songs from Bush’s album The Red Shoes. “It was a great invitation because I could be a fly on the wall. No fancy set ups, just me recording what was happening.” He’s particularly proud of his shot of Bush asleep on set in her curlers with Kemp posing behind her head. “I know she was disappointed in the film, she maybe thought it was a flop - not commercially but for her. So the photos were never published.” That shoot marked the end of their collaboration, but there could have been another chapter. In 1998, Bush phoned Harari and asked if he would photograph her with guitarist Danny McIntosh and their newborn son, Bertie. “I said, ‘No. This is a private moment, keep it as it is.’” Harari goes back to that Hounds of Love shoot, recalling Bush’s rapid transformations. First she appeared in an orange jacket with padded shoulders. “She looked like Joan Collins. And then she went off to the dressing room and came out wearing this fabulous purple scarf, like a woman from 1900. And then she disappeared again and I wondered where she was, so I went to the dressing room. And there she was sitting in a chair in this thick white Kabuki make up. She looked great, even with the powder still on her shoulders, but there was one detail missing – so I took her lipstick and smeared it across her lips.” The Kate Inside is available from Wall of Sound Gallery.

      "Unearthly wails, Chvrches cheese and a fleeting Ghostface Killah haunt SXSW Anyone playing on the Radio Day Stage of the Austin Conference Centre deserves a medal for bravery – it’s hard to imagine a more soulless venue for a concert. It’s even more impressive when someone has the intensity to make you forget about the 70s lecture theatre-style ambience. Buckinghamshire native Jack Garratt pulled off exactly this feat on Friday lunchtime. Face screwed up, attacking a drum machine with one hand and playing a keyboard with another, he unleashed some unearthly soulful whimpers and wails during The Love You’re Given. He’s not a million miles from the Jacko-esque vocal stylings of the Weeknd, but is coming at R&B from an entirely different angle – as he proved when he straps on a guitar and plays a riff that could strip the formica off the venue’s buffet tables. This is Worry, originally released in 2014, which manages to be darkly compelling but still have a radio-friendly hook. It’s no surprise that he’s won the BBC Sound of 2016 poll and Critic’s Choice at the Brits, but to his credit there is no element of coffee-table smugness in his performance. Chvrches take the opposite presentation tack. Lined up behind a table with their computers and keyboards at chest height, they look as though they’re about to conduct a science experiment. Or, as singer Lauren Mayberry said while adjusting her synthesizer: “I feel like a bad children’s presenter from the 80s – but not that kind of a bad one.” The audience whoops, encouraging a slightly grating between-song chat – the anecdote, including one about “feeling like Jon Bon Jovi” when she asked for cheese at a gig, and fans showed her pictures of cheese on their phones – almost went on longer than the music. When the tunes arrive they’re stripped of the enjoyable bombast that fills the recorded versions, but they still strike home thanks to Mayberry’s piercing voice and the skyscraper-sized melodies. Never Ending Circles has a chorus that is 100% proof, while Leave a Trace is sleekly soulful. Despite stagecraft that amounts to little more than a few frowns and shuffles from the other two members, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty, it’s a confident triumph. Stormzy has been one of the busiest musicians at SXSW. He’s done the rounds at showcases and even attended a boat cruise, but Fader Fort was a chance to preach to the convertible. Along with acts such as Elf Kid, Little Simz, Lorne Carter and Rejjie Snow (Section Boyz were suppose to play but cancelled), he’s been responsible for showing America what grime and UK/Irish hip-hop is all about. A small crowd gathered, with a sizable South London contingent in the front, to hear Stormzy riff on the importance of post codes, MCs’ Twitter faux pas and putting doubters in their place. For someone who is a bonafide known name in the UK, Stormzy had to go through the motions of introducing himself after every track. He did so with humility and an understanding that more than 10 years after Boy In Da Corner, grime is still mostly an unknown quantity for US hip-hop fans. Some things do translate though, and when he played his biggest hit to date, Shut Up, there were head nods of recognition and a mass singalong. That energy grew when he finished with Where Do You Know Me From? – which saw actual pogoing. There was a full on circle pit at Deftones, who played the Spin showcase at Stubb’s BBQ. The nu-metal survivors drew a crowd that could hardly fit in the venue and ran through a decent amount of their 2000 album, White Pony, with Feiticeira, Knife Prty and Change (In The House Of Flies) all sending fans whirling. Chino Moreno’s voice has lost none of it’s otherworldly squeal, and when Stephen Carpenter started the main riff of My Own Summer (Shove It), Moreno let off a high pitched sound that set the circle pit off all over again. The Ninja Tune showcase was a mixed bag with early performers such as Taylor McFerrin, Leon Vynehall and Machinedrum showing the full breadth of the label’s (and its imprints such as Brainfeeder) sound. McFerrin blended jazz with down-tempo electronica that was at times plodding; Vynehall mixed up his productions with a DJ set that led into Machinedrum’s showcase, a mix of new productions which reached gabber levels of ear-drum punishment. That cleansed the palette before Ghostface Killah entered stage left – or did he? At first he sent on a young group whose name couldn’t be made out through the over saturated PA system. Once they finished a couple of a songs, to a crowd that was generous considering they weren’t on the bill – and considering they sounded like a Whitehouse track played backwards – Ghostface’s DJ came on. He proceeded to complain about the monitors for five minutes, before winning the crowd back with a whistle-stop tour through some of hip-hop’s milestones: the likes of Dead Prez, Luniz, Biz Markie and Beastie Boys. The air was sucked out of the room, though, when Ghostface Killah finally appeared and was barely audible. His middle section picked up once the sound issues were resolved, and Cappadonna joined him on stage for renditions of Tearz, Da Mystery of Chessboxin’, Ice Cream and CREAM, but they were fleeting moments in a performance that lacked the class everyone knows he can produce. It was left to Moodymann to finish the night off. After some technical difficulties of his own, during which he joined fans at the front to give away CDs and signed T-shirts, he delivered. In an apparent nod to those who came before him, he played ODB’s Got Your Money and Junie Morrison’s Suzie Thundertussy, which is itself sampled on Kanye West’s No More Parties In LA, which also samples Ghostface Killah. Wearing what looked like a beekeeper’s hat and veil, he then stepped things up, rattling off 2012’s Ibiza standout Around, by Noir & Haze, and DJ Nature’s Let It Ring. Never boring, always eclectic it showed why a show must go on attitude is vital to SXSW.\n",
      "Music shone through my wife’s Alzheimer’s Laura Barton’s description of Hannah Peel’s relationship with her gran through music (Waking moments, G2, 23 November) brought back so many memories of my wife’s struggle with Alzheimer’s. Denise died last year having struggled with Alzheimer’s for five years. She had been a music teacher and church organist in her early life but, even though I was able to care for her at home until the end, her memory and recognition failed early on in the disease. However, even when she slept most of the time, hymns would sometimes bring a smile to her lips, not least the weekly Songs of Praise on a Sunday afternoon. Such was the awakening that she would join in with most hymns and was word perfect. As the final credits rolled Denise would close her eyes and return to her abyss of darkness.

      "Earth, Wind & Fire review – a groove parday with the funk soul uncles When Earth, Wind & Fire were in their funky late-70s pomp, they put on some of the most theatrical pop shows ever seen. Their silver outfits could have come straight from Star Trek and bassist Verdine White’s favourite party piece was levitating several feet above the stage. Now, after making music for 45 years, they’re down to three remaining original members. Founding singer (and Verdine’s brother) Maurice White exited the touring lineup in the 90s owing to Parkinson’s disease; he died this year. Ralph Johnson has departed the drum kit for a less physically demanding percussion role. However, at 65, singer Philip Bailey’s extraordinary falsetto still visits places usually made possible only by painfully tight trousers. Nowadays, Verdine White remains rooted to the spot, although his red sparkly flares could provide several families with Christmas decorations and his rubbery funk basslines deliver the throbbing power for a near two-hour “parday”. Opening with signature tune Boogie Wonderland would be foolhardy if the band didn’t have plenty more where that came from, and the 1979 song has been given something of a makeover. With the 13-piece band augmented by younger musicians, including Bailey’s son, a new middle section flits from Latin to Kraftwerk-style electronics to house music, ending with the musicians spinning on their heels into a collective Black Panthers-type salute. In a breathless opening salvo, Jupiter and Shining Star demonstrate the band’s trademark ability to lay down stupidly funky grooves, showered with disco, pop and soul. It’s a shame, then, that with the entire if undersold arena audience on their feet, a lengthy middle section of purist’s favourites, slower-paced songs and instrumental sections promptly has them sitting down again, although the rest is perhaps welcomed by the more venerable members of the audience. Still, there’s a lovely moment when Maurice White appears on screen to “sing” with his surviving peers, and in grainy black and white images of the band in their prime. Bailey wonders aloud how many people present were conceived to the sound of EWF’s funky-pumpy. The smoother soul After the Love Has Gone probably soundtracked more divorces than lovey-dovey, although Bailey seems close to tears when the song is taken up by an impromptu, mostly female audience choir. The brassy cover of the Beatles’ Got to Get You Into My Life gets the party restarted in no uncertain terms, before Fantasy and September sound exactly as they should. With barely anything with a date stamp past 1980 and well-worn, if effective, call-and-response routines, it’s a show that leans mostly on nostalgia and old-fashioned showmanship, but keeps Maurice White’s life’s work alive. If the late frontman is visiting in spirit, he would surely be thrilled to witness the jubilant reception given the 35-year-old Let’s Groove, as every audience member follows Bailey’s tried and trusted command to “wave your hands in the air, wave them like you just don’t care”.\n",
      "Think Leicester will fold against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal? Think again If all eyes have admiringly and disbelievingly been on Leicester City for a great deal of this Premier League season, the focus is about to get that little bit sharper. England’s buccaneering pacesetters have in front of them a large hurdle that has all the makings of an important signpost in this remarkable campaign. Within the space of 12 days Leicester confront three difficult assignments. “Three unbelievable matches,” emphasised Claudio Ranieri. Liverpool at home on Tuesday, followed by Manchester City away and Arsenal away. That little flurry includes the only two sides to have beaten them in the Premier League so far this season, with the bookies’ favourite to finish top sandwiched between. “It’s important to be ready,” added Ranieri, making all the right noises about his team feeling strong at the moment. Come teatime on Valentine’s Day, at the end of this mini-series, it will be very revealing to see if he can still make light and chuckle away at the questions about Leicester’s title hopes. Think they are bound to falter? Think again. Of course, this being unscripted sport none of us have the slightest clue really, but the big positive Leicester have going for them is they were supposed to drop off a cliff once already this season and they managed to maintain their footing. Not so long ago, beginning in late November, a bunch of tricky fixtures loomed over the course of a testing month, including Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool and Manchester City. Leicester came unstuck in only one of those fixtures – losing narrowly at Anfield. They began that period top by one point, and ended it second only on goal difference, so any expectations that they would have a serious wobble were adeptly answered. Leicester’s fortune in keeping so many crucial players fit enough to play the majority of the games has given them a great foundation. Naturally, any serious injuries will test Ranieri’s resources, but the purchases of Daniel Amartey and Demarai Gray during January are promising ones. Judging by the way most of the summer signings have shone, with N’Golo Kanté, Christian Fuchs, Robert Huth (who made his successful loan from Stoke a permanent move) and Shinji Okazaki all becoming mainstays in the team, the manager has shown a great touch for bringing in players who are ready to adapt quickly to the fast, determined tempo that has served Leicester so well. Joining a settled and optimistic dressing room, the vibes around the team continue to be upbeat and fiercely driven. Although the Premier League summit remains, quite rightly, their priority, Leicester ought to be keeping a eye on the distance between them and the team fifth in the table, currently Manchester United. Could there be a greater confidence boost in the last few weeks of the season than confirming a place in the Champions League? The gap over United at the moment is 10 points. Keeping a comfortable cushion should be a huge incentive, because, irrespective of how the title challenge ends up, a Champions League position would in itself be a staggering achievement. It has been an age since a team from the Midlands has been represented in Europe’s elite competition. None of Leicester’s current players were even born around the golden age in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa flourished. More recently, following the modernisation of the European Cup from the 1990s onwards, English football’s modern history has no precedent for a club outside the traditional power bases, one without a domestic title on its honours board, qualifying for the Champions League. It has never happened before. When English football first saw its number of qualification spots increased to four, during the 2001-02 season, it was reasonable to imagine a greater spread of teams could gain access to the prosperous, luxurious, promised land of the Champions League. In reality the opposite occurred. Since 2001-02, a Champions League ticket has been claimed 57 times by English clubs (this includes a bonus spot, when Liverpool won the competition in 2005 so even though they finished outside the top four they were allowed special dispensation to join in). The usual suspects – Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City – have taken up 53 of those 57 slots. Outside that list of heavyweights, Newcastle qualified twice (failing once to reach the group stage), and Everton (also failing to reach the groups) and Tottenham once each. Back in 2001-02, Leicester City were anything but one of those clubs hungrily eyeing up a Champions League position. They were relegated, the first team to drop out of the Premier League that season, and finished in bottom place. It was a doleful and worrying way to bid farewell to their ancestral home, Filbert Street. With spiralling debts as they endeavoured to pay for a new stadium, they went into administration. The weeks ahead offer tantalising opportunity. A shot at history. The chance to do something nobody thought possible when Ranieri was appointed to take over from Nigel Pearson continues to be astounding.\n",

      "Van Williams obituary The actor Van Williams, who has died aged 82, achieved brief fame as the masked comic-book hero the Green Hornet in the 1960s US television series of the same name. As Britt Reid, a playboy media mogul who owns a newspaper and TV station, he was seen transforming into his alter ego to tackle criminals with hand-to-hand combat and two deadly weapons, a gas gun and the Hornet’s Sting sonic blaster. He was aided by Bruce Lee (in his first TV role) as Kato, his valet and martial arts expert, and Black Beauty, a customised Chrysler Crown Imperial sedan fitted with infra-green headlights, hood-mounted machine guns, a grille-mounted flame thrower and Stinger missiles stashed in the bumpers. Unfortunately for Williams, the masked vigilante – created for radio in the 30s by George Trendle and Fran Striker – was unleashed on television viewers in 1966 shortly after the launch of the hugely popular, camped-up Batman TV series, from the same producers. “One of the things I absolutely insisted upon was that I was going to play it straight,” said Williams. “None of this ‘wham, bam, thank you, ma’am’ stuff that was going on with Batman.” But one critic described the star in costume as looking like an “overgrown grasshopper” and the drama was cancelled after just one run of 26 episodes. Williams was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of Priscilla (nee Jarvis) and Bernard Williams, who ran a ranch. After attending Arlington Heights high school and studying animal husbandry and business at Texas Christian university, Williams headed for the South Pacific in 1956 to work as a salvage diver. The following year, Mike Todd, the theatre and film producer, spotted him and suggested he go into acting. He took vocal and drama lessons, worked on contract to Revue Studios for six months, soon landed bit parts on TV, then signed up for six years to Warner Bros. His big break came in the detective drama Bourbon Street Beat (1959-60) with the role of Kenny Madison, a private eye operating from above a restaurant in the French quarter of New Orleans. He reprised the role in another crime series, Surfside 6 (1960-62), featuring detectives with an office on a Miami houseboat. Switching to sitcom, Williams played Pat Burns, assistant to the cantankerous billionaire Walter Andrews (played by Walter Brennan) and pilot of his private plane, in The Tycoon (1964-65). He later took the role of Steve Andrews, the father in a family on a journey around Pacific islands, in the children’s adventure series Westwind (1975) and appeared on and off (1976-78) as Captain MacAllister in How the West Was Won. Williams became a reserve deputy in the Los Angeles county sheriff’s department in 1971, working part time at its Malibu station, where he also captained the mountain rescue team and was a volunteer firefighter. In 1982, he retired from acting to concentrate on running the telecommunications company he had set up in Santa Monica 13 years earlier. He was a partner in a 4,000-acre ranch in Hawaii and he enjoyed hunting geese, duck, elk and other game. “I didn’t really care that much for the acting business,” Williams said. “I didn’t like the people in it, the way they operated and all the phoniness and back-stabbing. It was not a very pleasant education for a guy from Texas whose handshake was his word. Plus, I’d gone into acting looking at it as a business, not wanting necessarily to be a celebrity.” Nevertheless, he jumped at the opportunity to take a cameo as the director of The Green Hornet in the film biopic Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993). Williams is survived by his second wife, Vicki Flaxman, whom he married in 1959, and their children, Nina, Tia and Britt; and by Lisa and Lynne, the twin daughters of his first marriage, to Drucilla Greenhaw, which ended in divorce. • Van Zandt Jarvis Williams, actor, born 27 February 1934; died 29 November 2016\n",
      "The targeting of Hillary Clinton suggests a vicious campaign ahead We now know how Donald Trump will take on Hillary Clinton this autumn – by framing her as a criminal who should be sent not to the White House, but to jail. Trump had already signalled as much via the two-word label he likes to hang around the neck of his Democratic opponent: Crooked Hillary. But the Republican convention in Cleveland, which on Tuesday formally nominated Trump as its presidential candidate, has given colour and shape to that strategy. Now we know how it will look and sound. Speaker after speaker has pressed the same themes: that Clinton is a liar who regards herself as above the law, that she is corrupt, that she is stained by a series of scandals going back 25 years. On Tuesday night, New Jersey governor Chris Christie used his turn at the podium to play prosecutor, asking the audience in the hall and watching on TV to act as a “jury of her peers” and sit in judgment on Hillary Clinton as he laid out the case against her. He had barely got going when the crowd in front of him began chanting “Lock her up! Lock her up!” Christie smiled indulgently, before promising: “All right, we’re getting there.” It was a telling moment, for it confirmed that, when it comes to this line of attack, the Republican party and the Trump campaign are following as much as they are leading. The activists of the right have been banging this same drum for months; some of them have been doing it for years. On Monday, in a lakeside Cleveland park, a rally convened by longtime Trump backer Roger Stone and the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was peppered with posters urging “Hillary for Prison”, alongside placards depicting the Democratic candidate as “wanted”, in the style of the old west. Also spotted around town: pictures of Clinton in an orange jumpsuit and behind bars. Christie sought to give substance to those slogans and memes. Much of his case related to policy decisions Hillary Clinton had taken, especially as secretary of state. But now those decisions – to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran or to thaw relations with Cuba – were refashioned as crimes. And as he worked through each item – Libya, Syria, China – he invited delegates to bellow their verdict. Never mind that some of the accusations were bizarre – including the claim that Clinton was an “apologist” for Boko Haram – the hall answered loudly and in chorus: “Guilty!” The old favourites got a run-out too, naturally. Hillary, said Christie – who having been passed over as a vice-presidential choice hopes to be attorney general in a Trump administration – had lied about the deaths of four US diplomats in Benghazi, deaths for which, according to earlier speakers in Cleveland, Clinton was directly culpable. And she had lied about her use of a private email server, offering an account which, Christie reminded his audience, the director of the FBI had recently deemed untrue. The audience lapped it up, of course they did. For this is the one thing on which all Republicans, those who backed Trump and those who opposed him, can agree: that Hillary Clinton is so corrupt that she must not be allowed to become president. Indeed, my conversations with delegates previously hostile to Trump suggest that this is what enables them to fall in behind the nominee: their belief that, morally speaking, Clinton is even worse. Strategically, you can see Team Trump’s logic. The polls are staggeringly bad for Clinton on this, with some 67% of Americans regarding her as not honest or trustworthy. It makes sense for Republicans to exploit that weakness. But there is a larger calculation at work. The Trump campaign has clearly concluded that there is not much it can do about their man’s stratospherically high disapproval ratings. (He is regarded as dishonest by 62% of Americans, for example, and his other numbers are even worse.) So if they can’t lift him up, they might as well tear her down. The result will be a relentlessly negative campaign from now until November, with both candidates depicting the other as the greater evil. And if talk of evil, rather than the merely criminal, sounds excessive, consider Tuesday’s closing speech by one of Trump’s former fellow candidates, Ben Carson. He suggested Clinton was a devotee of a man, the long-ago radical Saul Alinsky, who had once praised … Lucifer. Yes: Hillary Clinton was just one degree of separation away from Satan. If this is what the Republicans are saying about their Democratic opponent in July, imagine what they’ll be saying come November.\n",
      "‘I’m with Nigel’: the Farage entourage tries to break America Finally, a catchphrase as iconic as “I’m with Vince”, the access-all-areas intro dropped by the hangers-on in Entourage. Say hello to “I’m with Nigel”, as the breakout star of Brexit tries to make it big in America, accompanied by his coat-tailing posse from back home. Don’t ask me the title of this shitshow, girls. Cause you know you just switched on Enfarage. First, the set-up. Nigel Farage is a leading man whose success in the referendum vote has drawn offers from That America. Specifically, from Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency, which has taken inspiration from the poll-busting Brexit result, and reportedly wants to pick his brains. Please don’t conclude that the relationship is being wildly exaggerated, and that Farage is so junior that even Trump’s people have people who deal with him. Instead, just get behind the fact that it’s finally happening – Nigel Farage is GOING WEST! He is LIVING THE DREAM! If you’re up to speed with the series, you’ll know that Nigel has already gone to the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Nigel has been permitted to open for Trump in Mississippi. Nigel has been said to be advising Trump in advance of the final two debates. Nigel is on Fox News. Nigel is in the spin room. Nigel is hotly tipped to play the lead in James Cameron’s Aquaman. I don’t know if Nigel has a mid-Atlantic accent yet, but when asked whether he would return as the permanent Ukip leader, his reply was genuinely “not for 10 million dollars”. Nigel, your official logo is a pound sign. Why are you suddenly speaking in dollars? Is this a bit like that Alan Partridge episode where his mate from the petrol station gets infatuated with a cod-American trucker called Tex? Or do you just prefer to talk in currencies that aren’t tanking? But wait, because Nigel also has a crew, who he wants with him for the journey because 1) he’s codependent, and 2) that’s the entire show, dude! Don’t take it from me – take it from Ukip financier Arron Banks, whose forthcoming book on the gang is called The Bad Boys of Brexit, and features a cover shot I’ve already captioned “Turtle, E, Vinnie, Drama”. The aforementioned bad boys are Arron, communications chap Andy Wigmore and another businessmen bankroller called Richard Tice. (“Tice is the worst!” honks Arron, presumably in a teaser for the episode Tice is the Worst.) Tice doesn’t seem to be with Nigel as we speak, but the others have caught a ride with him at various stages of the US journey. And why not? Entourage was, of course, a show whose almost ineffably complex and nuanced four-way bromance was best summarised in the following exchange: E: “Could you get laid without Vince? That’s the question?” Turtle: “Do I give a fuck? That’s the answer!” So picture the same dynamic, only with Nigel Farage. Of course, I mean it only metaphorically as far as the bad boys of Enfarage are concerned. I’m pretty sure they all have wives, estranged or otherwise and, anyway, they wouldn’t have gone near the traditional RNC hookers’n’coke bonanza. Fine wines, yes. Blowing rails off a paid friend while telling her about the Breaking Point poster? Don’t be absurd. Essentially, these are country mice. I get the feeling they’re a bit “unsettled” by alt-right comers such as Milo Yiannopolous . Of course, there are some characters too silly even to make the Enfarage cut. There is Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam, for instance, who is running for the Ukip leadership under the Trump-frotting slogan Make Britain Great Again. Raheem once poignantly bought the same coat as Nigel, but his puritan dullardry is preventing him getting even a three-episode arc. “Irony of Trump tape,” ran a Raheem tweet revealing a grasp of irony to make Alanis Morissette’s look Sophoclean. “The left has pushed sex liberation & filthy Hollywood culture for decades. Now complaining about the language it causes.” “Complaining about the language”? Also, “filthy Hollywood culture”? Obviously, no one expects Raheem to have a clue as to why so many Republican women are vocally enraged and disgusted by Trump’s sexual assault boasts – he presumably last spoke to a female sometime during the Dubya administration. But it’s an interesting choice to run for the Ukip leadership on a Mary Whitehouse platform, and he is advised to manage his expectations accordingly. Back to Nigel, though. Back to our star. Clearly, this is the most concerted attempt to break America since Robbie Williams moved there for a decade and became the de facto leader of the Brits in LA for No Good Reason. Robbie’s US career basically consisted of hosting five-a-side football matches for fellow time-rich expats such as Vinnie Jones. Farage’s strategy, in contrast, is to get as close to Trump’s campaign as he possibly can, build up his recognition Stateside, and hope it doesn’t end up like when Cheryl went to US X Factor. Thus he’ll do anything. Farage is now the Paul Ross of the Trump campaign – as in, his answerphone message says: “I’ll do it.” Wait – the candidate has been taped bragging about grabbing women’s pussies? Fine, Nigel will go on Fox News to defend him. Like he told the anchor, Trump’s apparent predilection for sexual assault was fine because “he’s not running to be pope”. Quite. That’s the last way to get ahead in the Catholic church. Anyway, the pope bit was sufficiently splashy for Nigel to be invited into the post-debate spinroom, where he dispensed further look-at-me lines. Trump, Farage declared, was “like a big silverback gorilla” – an analysis that makes me wonder if those paw ashtrays are always morally wrong. Either way, the last thing you should think is that Nigel is coming off like a small fish in a massive pond. “I’ve been there myself,” he mused of the first presidential debate. “I remember my first debate.” Thanking you, Obi-Wan. What is the endgame to all this? If Nigel has an Ari Gold figure, where is he steering him? My feeling is that Farage ultimately wants a berth on Trump TV, the network Trump is rumoured to be launching should his presidential bid fail. Our natural instinct is probably to see Nigel occupying the Partridgean 3am-6am graveyard slot. Then again, in the world of Trump, maybe the small hours are prime time? God knows that’s when the candidate has done some of his most eye-catching work. Or perhaps Nigel hopes Trump will employ him as a sidekick on his own show – kind of like Hank on Larry Sanders. The fear, naturally, is that Nigel will end up some kind of Madge Allsop figure – monstrously insulted and abused, but too beaten to find the courage to escape. All we can do is remind Nigel that lil’ ol’ Britannia will be waiting for him with open arms if all goes tits up. Leave a $10 bill on her nightstand, Nige, and tell her about the time you were big in America.\n",
      "Massive Attack: ‘There was always someone out there ready to bash your head in’ Backstage at the Dublin Olympia Theatre, down a corridor decorated with a painting of Phil Lynott so hideous it appears to have been painted by someone with a longstanding personal grudge against the late Thin Lizzy frontman, Massive Attack’s dressing room is tiny, scruffy and stiflingly hot. In its confines sit Robert “3D” Del Naja and Grant “Daddy G” Marshall. The former is voluble and intense, the latter friendly but even more laconic than he was the last time I met them, in 2009, a state of affairs I didn’t think was possible. “Why don’t you say something?” asks Del Naja plaintively, at one juncture: “I don’t want to say anything,” frowns Marshall, famously no great fan of the interview process. “I’ve got nothing to say. I don’t need to talk about anything.” Glamour is in very short supply in the dressing room, unless you count the large framed photo of David Bowie – with whom Massive Attack once collaborated on a version of the jazz standard Nature Boy – exuding insouciant cool on the Olympia’s stage, and a large wicker basket that has just been delivered, containing champagne, Guinness, a recipe for black velvet cocktails and a card welcoming them to Dublin. “It’s from U2,” Marshall says. “A very nice gesture,” Del Naja agrees, reading the card. “‘Best of luck.’” He frowns. “We need it. We need all the fucking luck we can get.” On the one hand, this is just Robert Del Naja being Robert Del Naja. For a man who began his musical life as a rapper – not a career much associated with understatement – and went on to release a succession of era-defining albums, including Massive Attack’s 1991 debut Blue Lines and 1998’s Mezzanine, sell 11m records, collaborating along the way with everyone from Bowie to Burial, Snoop Dogg to Sinéad O’Connor, he is remarkably self-deprecating. A pioneering graffiti artist hailed as an influence by Banksy, he has exhibited visual art around the world, but startled a journalist who came to talk to him at a recent London gallery show by informing them that he was “a chancer” who didn’t really know what his own paintings looked like because he is colour blind: “People tell me it’s great and I pretend that’s what I intended.” Over the past 15 years, Del Naja has become famous as one of a scant handful of rock stars who engage in political activism – Massive Attack have worked with the Stop the War coalition and visited refugee camps in Lebanon, while in 2011, Del Naja and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke threw a party for Occupy protesters who had taken over a UBS bank building in London. Nevertheless, he seems at pains to play it down. “What’s happened is that once you’ve planted a flag in the sand in one place, people will come and say, ‘Look, do you want to get involved in this and that and the other?’ It’s good to learn and be engaged and listen to people, see what’s going on. But that’s not the motivator: if I was a political person, I’d have gone into politics. I just get involved in things when people come to me: I’m not a musician-slash-activist, that’s not the word.” On the other, the first date of Massive Attack’s European tour does seem to be attended by a certain sense of mild panic. The tour was meant to be low-key, small venues, a means of introducing new songs – some of them so new that, as vocalist Martina Topley-Bird later confesses onstage, they haven’t actually come up with titles yet. But the tickets sold out and more dates got added and somehow the UK leg of their low-key tour of small venues has wound up concluding with three nights at London’s 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy. In addition, there’s the sheer complexity of Massive Attack’s audio-visual performance to take into account. This time out it incorporates more than the band’s trademark LED screens, created by Del Naja and London’s United Visual Artists group, that flash up facts, figures, headlines and gibberish created by a “news generator”, as well as news stories and information specific to whichever city the band are playing in. Apparently, they are a big enough headache in themselves. “Every place we go to, we change them to the local language, so in Belgium, we’ve got to do fucking French and Flemish,” Del Naja says. “In Switzerland, we’ve got to do French and German and Italian. You never know which language most of the audience speak, and whichever one it is, they start booing when the other one comes up.” In addition, the show also features the work of Giles Duley, the former rock photographer who lost both legs and his left arm after stepping on an IED while taking photographs in Afghanistan in 2011 and who has spent the past couple of years on what is known as the refugee trail, taking portrait photographs everywhere from Syria and Lebanon to the Greek islands and Calais. “He’s captured everything, it’s remarkable,” Del Naja says. “Just shots of people. It’s apolitical, really, but they give you a real understanding of how immense and tragic the whole thing is, how important the right response is. I was a bit concerned about putting his photographs to pop music, effectively, but it does have a power and he wants it to be communicated. So we’ve ended up with this mix of reality and … aesthetic pleasure, statistics, a bit of journalism, some irony. It’s a kind of balancing act; you don’t want to be sort of relentlessly battering people over the head with facts when, after all, they’re coming here to be entertained, apparently. But you also want people to get what you’re doing, you want them to join the dots; you don’t want to trivialise anything.” To that end, Del Naja called filmmaker Adam Curtis in to the final rehearsals. They collaborated with him and stage designer Es Devlin on a multimedia piece for the 2013 Manchester International festival: this time, says Del Naja, his job was to “idiot-proof” the show, and “make sure it had some political coherence, make sure people could understand what we were trying to say”. And what are you trying to say? “Well, when we started with the LED screens it was the beginning of the internet age, so it was about data and information, how it was regurgitated, the feedback loops that were created by that. Now the whole world is consumed by the internet and the internet consumes us, so it’s very different. I think, right now, this particular iteration of the show, is more saying …” He pauses. “We’re all fucked,” he says. “We’re all fucked. Wouldn’t it be nice if these utopian tech companies could save us? But that’s not likely to happen, so we’re all fucked.” It’s a mood that permeates the first new Massive Attack material in six years, four songs, helmed by Del Naja, that appeared first not for download or on vinyl, but as an app, Fantom, that uses information from mobile phones – location, movement, time of day, images from the camera – to manipulate the music, “making dub mixes for yourself as opposed to having them pre-mixed for you”, as Del Naja puts it. The versions coming out as an EP meanwhile, feature a variety of guest appearances: Roots Manuva, a new singer from London called Azekel and Scottish trio Young Fathers, whom Del Naja describes as “currently the best fucking band in the world”. Perhaps most excitingly for longstanding Massive Attack fans, they also feature the return of rapper Tricky, who departed the band amid some acrimony after 1995’s Protection. On one level, it sounds like a charmingly romantic, even nostalgic reunion. Recording at his home in Paris, Tricky insisted Del Naja should rap, something he eschewed years ago in favour of a vocal style he jokingly describes as “melodic whispering”. The pair ended up “both of us on the same microphone, doing it all in one take”. On the other, it is clear the reunion wasn’t without its tensions. “It’s always going to be slightly odd working with someone after so much time has passed,” says Del Naja. “But after half a day, you revert to type, all the veneer’s stripped, all the posturing’s gone and you’re just what you were back then, 20 years ago, whether you like it or not. You just realise: ‘Oh, I haven’t fucking changed at all, I’ve got all the same issues, he knows how to push my buttons, I know how to push his.’ But that’s the nature of it. It’s kind of funny and difficult at the same time. He literally forced me to rap – ‘Chap, you’d better start bloody rapping again!’ We did it in one take, and afterwards, Tricks goes, ‘You’ll never do that again’, and I said, ‘Let’s hope not.’” The new material sounds fantastic, but there’s no mistaking the bleakness of its tone. Then again, Massive Attack have always been a bit like that. The popular image of them as laid-back West Country stoners upon whom an inexplicable mood of paranoid gloom seemed to descend during the fraught sessions for Mezzanine doesn’t really hold up. When Blue Lines was reissued a few years ago, what was striking about the album that virtually singlehandedly spawned the chilled-out trip-hop genre was how resolutely un-chilled it sounded: the braggadocio of its raps spiked with intimations of isolation and depression, the lyrics to Safe from Harm anxiously painting a nocturnal world of “gun men and maniacs”. Del Naja thinks it had something to do with “navigating the choppy waters of nightlife in Bristol” in the 80s: the scene that gave birth to the Wild Bunch, the mythical hip-hop crew that eventually became Massive Attack, appears to have been far from the relaxed multiracial melting-pot it’s frequently painted as. “In the old days, you stepped out, you had to think about what you were wearing, you had to get out at the right time, you had to stand in a corner, you didn’t fucking tread on anybody’s foot, you didn’t make eye contact with the wrong geezer, you definitely didn’t burn someone with your fag. You did anything wrong, you were fucked. You grew up with that survival thing, of how you might get through the night or through an afternoon down the city centre, going to Virgin Records, without getting your head kicked in.” “We had our group that we all moved with, so there was always some sense of safety,” says Marshall, suddenly animated. “But there was always that thing, you know, of someone out there ready to bash your head in if you stepped out of line. Going back to where we were with Massive Attack and the Wild Bunch, it was always a mixed-race thing, so we were always going into circumstances where it could go either way. Either he could get beaten up for being in the wrong place because he’s in a Jamaican club with me, or I could get beaten up for being a black bloke in a punk club. So we were always treading water in that respect.” Massive Attack have, of course, been accused of treading water in other ways. Their reputation as, in Del Naja’s words, “lazy Bristol bastards” who manage to release something every six years precedes them, although he, in particular, seems a veritable Stakhanovite, churning out film scores, music for computer games and soundtracks to art installations. There’s another Massive Attack EP on the way, this time comprising tracks produced by Marshall, although getting information about that proves a pretty thankless task: “I don’t want to talk about it until it’s finished,” Marshall says. After that, there should be an album, although no one seems entirely certain when: Del Naja has been in the studio with a succession of intriguing collaborators, including Run the Jewels and Jack Barnett of These New Puritans. For now, there are more immediately pressing matters to deal with. The pair vanish off to soundcheck, with Del Naja still fretting about the show. “There’s a musical arc, there’s a visual arc, blah blah blah, and amongst that you’re trying to make various points or highlight things or examine things, but then you take that too far and you alienate your audience: people who’ve known you or lived with you for 20, 25 years, you don’t want them coming to a show and just being turned off. It’s a balancing act, and it’s stressful.” He needn’t have worried. Later that night, the show is variously overwhelming, potent and, at times, genuinely moving. No one in the audience seems remotely turned off: they receive the new songs pretty rapturously, bellow when Young Fathers and Azekel make their appearances and chant Horace Andy’s name when the veteran reggae singer leaves the stage. As it ends, Del Naja takes the microphone. “Thanks,” he mutters apologetically, amid a gale of applause, “for putting up with us.” The Ritual Spirit EP is out now on Virgin/EMI. Massive Attack play the O2 Academy, Birmingham, on 30 January, then tour the UK until 5 February. Details: massiveattack.co.uk\n",
      "Liar, liar: in a post-truth world, writers reveal their biggest fib ‘Not only had I never done any form of martial art in my entire life, but I couldn’t even do any exercise’ When I was 21, I lived in Hong Kong, having dropped out of university in London and basically run away. Somehow it worked: I was soon making a living working as an extra in Chinese soap operas, which were broadcast on the mainland but shot in Hong Kong, where it was easier to find white people to play roles such as “foreign woman standing at the back of a party”. I played her quite a lot. Many backpackers tried it for a couple of weeks and then moved on, but I had a childhood background in drama and was keen, so the offers improved. They peaked when I got invited to Jackie Chan’s studios to audition for an unspecified part in his forthcoming film Hot War. By this point, I really felt I was made of magic: I was just some girl from Yorkshire who couldn’t even handle uni – how on earth had any of this happened? So when I got there and filled in the form, which asked if I knew any martial arts, I wrote a big YES. Then I sat and waited, reading all of Jackie Chan’s birthday cards from his mates, which were stapled to his office door. He was away, but the producers finally called me in for my screen test. I think I was videoed reading a few lines from a script. I’m not entirely sure, because all I really remember is the bit where they said, reading from my notes, that I could apparently do martial arts? “YES,” I repeated. Not only was this utterly untrue – I had never done any form of martial art in my entire life – but I couldn’t even do any exercise. I was the least sporty person you could imagine, entirely uncoordinated, and had also acquired a beer belly from enjoying the tropical expat lifestyle rather too much. “Can you show us a high kick?” they asked. “YES!” I repeated, by now fully believing in angels, miracles and just the basic amazingness of me. I wouldn’t say that I fell over exactly, more that my attempt to thrust my leg into the air derailed the rest of my body and the floor seemed to shake a little as my arms flew up towards the heavens. I imagine that, for the panel of Chinese experts watching me, it was a little like watching an elephant pretend to be a bird. “Ah,” they said. I did not get the part. Looking back, I’m not even embarrassed. It just felt so madly wonderful to be free. Sophie Heawood ‘He shot me a look of withering, friendship-destroying contempt. All my bullshit turned to ash’ The Argos catalogue said: “Snake Mountain. Skeletor’s stronghold. Talk into the wolf’s head and your voice changes into a scary voice of evil.” It should have said: “Snake Mountain. A plastic box that looks as if it once contained dildos. Talk into the cruddy, spring-operated box and your voice sounds exactly the goddamn same.” But I was five. I wanted it badly. Everyone else wanted Snake Mountain, too, but it was £40. Nobody’s parents could justify throwing that sort of money around. Matthew’s house was bigger than mine. His school jumper wasn’t handknitted, and he had more toys. One day, he told me he’d just bought Night Stalker, Skeletor’s gold robot horse. The seed of an inferiority complex kicked in for the very first time, and I did something stupid. “Yeah, well, I just bought Snake Mountain,” I lied. My regret was instant. Matthew wasn’t the type of kid who would easily forget this. He wanted to come to my house to see it. I tried putting him off, but it didn’t work. He went above my head, asking my mum if he could come for tea. She said yes, so I was screwed. I pleaded with my parents to buy me Snake Mountain, but they wouldn’t budge. I racked my brain, thinking up ways to cobble together £40, but none came. Eventually, in a fit of abject, sweat-drenched desperation, a solution appeared like a ray of light from heaven. The next day Matthew came over, brimming with excitement. With my heart in my mouth, I led him upstairs. I opened my bedroom door. And then… “That’s not Snake Mountain.” I was anticipating this reaction. He was right. It wasn’t Snake Mountain at all. It was a damp cardboard box on which I’d drawn a wonky face in Biro. “Yes, it is,” I replied, determined to front it out. I cupped my hands around my mouth. “Listen to my scary voice. Rargh.” Matthew shot me a look of withering, friendship-destroying contempt. All my bullshit turned to ash. This pitiful “my greatest toy is my imagination” shtick held no truck with him. He was furious. “Don’t tell anyone,” I whispered. As mortifying as this still is – to this day, I can’t look at Snake Mountain without feeling my stomach lurch – it did teach me some important lessons about life. It taught me that actions have consequences. It taught me that it’s always better to own up. And, most importantly, it taught me that I should have bought Snake Mountain and left it in its box. Those things go for hundreds of quid now. Stuart Heritage ‘Where’s my salad, he asked. I told him it was still defrosting’ If there was some way of communicating to a bull that china is worth preserving, I’m sure it would have most of the motor skills required to tread carefully through that shop. I say this because, as a teenager, I was that bull – at least when it came to lying. I just didn’t know when to do it. When I was 15, instead of asking my parents if I could “sleep over at a friend’s house”, as any normal teen would, I asked if I could stay with my 19-year-old boyfriend for two nights. It was all about practicality, you see: we were driving to Oxford one day and Alton Towers the next, and driving to and from my parents’ house on top of all that would have been a pain. Unsurprisingly, they answered (and I’m paraphrasing), “No, 15-year-old-daughter, you obviously may not stay at your much older boyfriend’s house.” I scoffed like Harry Enfield’s Kevin: “Ugh! What’s the problem? His parents aren’t even going to be there!” They laughed, loudly. “You think we’re worried you’ll be putting his parents out?” Relieved at my innocence, but amused by my stupidity, they laughed for roughly 17 years. I worked out the whole lying thing embarrassingly late. I was 17, and had started working Sundays as a waitress in crap pubs on the outskirts of Slough. Early on, I got in trouble for telling an unnecessary truth. The first customer of the day had ordered a sandwich. When I brought it, he asked, “Where’s the salad?” I told him it was still defrosting. During the dressing down that followed, I had an epiphany. When the truth will provoke a bad reaction, you can just... lie. It’s magic, essentially. In an establishment where lettuce and pre-sliced tomatoes needed thawing, and the chef morphed from “still drunk” to “monstrously hungover” in the first two hours of the day, lying became my shiny new toy. For a while, I continued to report customer comments to the chef – “They say the bacon is undercooked/the cabbage is raw/the gravy is lumpier than a rice pudding” – even though the response was always, “Well, tell ’em to fuck off – it’s my fucking menu.” But eventually I would just stand in the kitchen for a count of 15 before going back to the table and giving my, “She says she’s really sorry…” speech. A grunt and a gruff acceptance usually followed. I had finally learned how to tiptoe through the china shop. Erica Buist ‘I was left unsupervised near a paper shredder, I told someone’ My forearms are striped with self-harm scars. These wounds were inflicted when I was much younger and fed up with everything. (I’m paraphrasing: I was clinically depressed, struggling to find the right medication, and in a lot of pain.) In those days, I wore long-sleeved shirts at all times, until it became unfeasible, or just absurd. You can’t go swimming in a shirt or play football in a cardigan. I am neither Thierry Henry nor Mr Darcy. Years later, when I was either confident or bored or hot enough to start wearing short sleeves again, people began to notice the scars. If they understood, they would stiffen imperceptibly, the conversation becoming suddenly strained. But often they didn’t and asked about them. That’s when I started lying. It’s just easier, I’d tell myself, watching relief flood their faces as I told them I owned a cat who scratched. (Animals offered a handy alibi for the wildness, and deepness, of some of the slashes.) Over time, though, my excuses grew more baroque. I referred darkly to an accident with a thresher, despite the fact the closest I’d ever got to harvesting cereals was bulk-buying Coco Pops. “I was left unsupervised near a paper shredder on work experience,” I told someone, without elaborating. As I got older and more frustrated with the question, the lies became preposterous: “My first job was training attack dogs for the police,” I’d tell people, looking them dead in the eye. Or, “I became entangled with a flotilla of jellyfish on a European holiday.” I sometimes wonder why I responded this way, and what lies beneath a lie. Unacknowledged anger towards the people asking? An English sense of the indecorous? Shame? I think elements of all of them were present, but there was something else, too. As many politicians can tell you, it’s fun to lie. It felt creative. To dip a toe into an alternative history, write my own backstory, go one better than the squalid truth. These days, I am stronger, with less need to lie. Telling the truth is uncomfortable, and can blow up in your face, but that’s the risk that makes any kind of connection precious. The scars on my arms have faded now, and blend better with my natural skin tone. I’m asked about them far less – which is ironic, because I’ve finally reached a point where I can talk about them honestly. Rhik Samadder ‘I pretended to be a Dalek hosting a party at Wagamama’ On occasion, a lie is preferable to the truth. I don’t lie much now, but I have lied an inordinate amount to celebrities. It’s generally been more a fudging of the truth than a downright deceit, and to me has always felt morally sound because it was told in pursuit of another virtue (a salary). I don’t for a minute want to normalise lying – it leads to a decline in trust that creates cynicism, and worse. But, sometimes, needs must. Here are my professional lies I lied to Jake Gyllenhaal I was a teen, he was a teen star; I was a bit drunk, outside the theatre on my own, and he, fresh from starring in Kenneth Lonergan’s This Is Our Youth, was hovering outside, waiting for his car. I walked over, shook his hand and discreetly passed over one of those boxes of matches with a space for your number. I told him I was from London (lie), 24 (lie) and would be happy to show him around. He smiled and said thank you (lie). I lied to Tony Wilson A music festival in Turin, Italy, in the mid-00s, where I lied repeatedly because I wanted to meet Factory Records founder Tony Wilson. First I lied to his manhandlers, a terrifying pair of stone dogs who guarded his DJ booth, then I lied to Tony in order to procure an interview. The lie – that I was a British journalist, not a student, in Turin to review music, and not for a holiday – worked. He did the interview, and then he died a couple of years later. I eventually sold the story posthumously. I’m not proud of this story. I lied to Bob Hoskins It was 2007 and I told him I liked his film. I lied to Benedict Cumberbatch During a roundtable interview with multiple journalists, I asked Benedict whether he felt he could relate to Sherlock in any way. He paused and fixed his eyes on me: “I don’t know what you are insinuating,” he said, because I was, of course, insinuating he had Asperger’s. “Nothing,” I muttered and passed the mic on. I was then asked where I worked and I lied to my fellow journalists, muttering about a blog. If anyone had known I was there for the News Of The World, asking that sort of thing, there’s a strong chance I would have been lynched. I pretended to be a Dalek’s publicist Or, rather, I was paid to lie in the name of social commentary (to ring up restaurants pretending to be a celebrity publicist and make outlandish demands for my clients). I did this a lot, pretending to represent Tom Cruise, George Clooney and Grace Coddington’s hair. A career high was the time I pretended to be a publicist representing a Dalek who wanted to host a dinner at Wagamama and to check there was sufficient wheelchair access. Yes, they said, there was. I stopped this line of work when the lying became too easy, and when real celebrity demands began to outweigh even my creativity. Morwenna Ferrier ‘Some people are rude to cold callers, some are icily polite and some hang up straight away. I always chose to lie’ I’ve been a freelance writer for 25 years, and in all that time I’ve never not been working. That is the main lie I tell. When people ring or email me about work, I always act and speak as if I am sitting at my desk. Sometimes I am sitting at my desk, but I might just as easily be downstairs watching Homes Under The Hammer, or sitting on the top deck of a bus, or standing in a dusty field in France. That thing I said I’d have finished for you today? Yes, I’m working on that right now and it’s nearly done. I never say, “I’m on holiday and I have no idea what you’re talking about.” When I am actually working at my desk, I don’t want to talk to anyone. I’m busy. Some people are rude to cold callers, some are icily polite and some hang up straight away. I always chose to lie, boldly and without effect. Whenever my phone rang, I deployed my all-purpose office hours response. “He’s not here,” I would say. If the person at the other end asked to leave a message, I would sigh heavily, like a useless personal assistant. “Yeah, fine,” I’d say, then pretend to write words on a pad. Sometimes it would turn out not to be a cold call at all, but an urgent inquiry about my lapsed house insurance. But once I started playing someone else, I had to carry on. “And who am I speaking with?” said the voice at the other end one day. This was unexpected. A long silence followed. “My name’s Ron,” I said. “Ron,” said the other voice, with transparent disbelief. “Yes,” I said. “R-o-n.” “When do you expect him back, Ron?” said the voice. “No idea,” I said. “He doesn’t tell me anything.” “OK,” said the voice, exasperated. “Thanks for your help, Ron.” I couldn’t understand what was so unconvincing about my bad-tempered PA. He reminded me so much of me, back when I was an office temp. Ron never passed on the message, and I later had to sack him, mostly because he required too much acting. But also because you would sack someone like Ron. No one who called back a week later would believe Ron still had a job. I haven’t answered my landline since. Tim Dowling ‘The only time I told a real whopper, I did it in style: on television, in front of millions’ I am a hopeless liar. In fact, I’m a compulsive truth-teller, to the point of self-destruction. The only time I can remember telling a real whopper, I did it in style: on television, in front of millions. It was, and remains, the low point of my career. I was due to interview the documentary-maker Louis Theroux for the in 2002. He insisted we do it in his office. I thought that was unfair; after all, he likes to follow his subjects around, see them in action. But there was no budging him. At the time, Theroux was making a TV show about the then-undisgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford. Like many journalists, I knew Clifford a bit, having interviewed his clients over the years. I asked him if there was any way he could get Theroux and I together before our formal, office-based interview. A few days later, I got a message telling me to meet Clifford at Sainsbury’s in Weybridge in a couple of hours. That was it. I hoped this was to do with Theroux, but there was no other information. (This was typical Clifford: keeping his cards close to his chest, manipulating Theroux and me at the same time.) I arrived at Sainsbury’s and spent half an hour self-consciously mooching around the aisles, then decided to leave before I got arrested for lurking with intent. But on my way out I walked into Louis Theroux, Max Clifford and a camera crew. Which is when everything went tits up. “Simon Hattenstone!” Theroux exclaimed loudly. “What are you doing here?” I hadn’t even anticipated this moment, when I would have to make something up. I burbled some incoherent nonsense about being there to interview Clifford, and suggested that now that we were all happily together, through pure serendipity, why didn’t we just carry on like a happy family; I could quietly observe Theroux observing Clifford. Theroux wasn’t having any of it. “Oh come on,” he said, “you’re obviously here because Max told you I’d be here.” No, I insisted, my eyes flitting nervously from Clifford to Theroux and back again. “I’m here to see Max.” “Do you often shop together?” he asked. Yes, no, yes, I don’t know, I whimpered. Why didn’t I just tell the truth? Because I felt a perverse loyalty to Clifford, who had set this up for my benefit. Theroux, slicker than me, suggested that if I had business to discuss with Clifford, I should walk around with him as he shopped, then leave them to make their film. So Clifford and I walked up and down the aisles. “Do you think we should level with him?” I asked. OK, begged. “Nooooo,” Clifford said, with utter assurance. “You came up to do a piece on me, you’ve read about the Louis thing, you know I come here every week.” Five minutes later, shopping completed, we returned to Theroux. “I don’t think you’ve been totally honest,” Theroux said to us. “I have,” I said, blushing, aware of a huge camera eyeballing me and wanting to die. “The thing is, Max left his mic on,” Theroux said, “and we could hear everything.” Clifford groped inside his shirt, threw the mic on the floor and walked out, shouting, “You can all fuck off!” Theroux and his crew, panicked and thrilled, raced after him. I was left alone, humiliated in Weybridge. For months after the documentary was broadcast, I was stopped on a regular basis. “Aren’t you the journalist who lied?” I was asked by a stranger on a train. People were surprisingly generous. They felt sorry for me, they said: I had been caught in a difficult situation, and it was obvious I’d wanted to tell the truth. Friends told my partner she was lucky to be with such a bad liar. And the Mirror got in touch to say they were so impressed by my “rabbit in the headlights impression” that they would like to offer me a job on their undercover investigations team. I think they were taking the piss. Simon Hattenstone ‘I announced to my classmates that my real family was in fact the A-Team’ Like most people, I grew up being told not to lie, and broke that rule when I was but a girl. As the daughter of immigrants, and someone who felt I was the wrong colour, culture and somehow born into the wrong family, I devised what I thought was an ingenious lie. I announced to my classmates that my real family was, in fact, the A-Team. Despite them pointing out that a small Asian woman called Nilu came to pick me up every day from school, I ploughed on. “That’s all a cover, you wallies, because of the Situation. My real father is Hannibal, but he’s on an international wanted list. Murdock is in a mental health institution and BA can’t get on a plane. So I’m having to stay with this family called the Hazarikas who live in Coatbridge for safety reasons. But I’ll be back with the gang soon.” It’s no wonder I ended up being a political spin doctor. I have since become highly conscious of the value of truth in a profession that can treat it casually. When I got my first job, as a junior press officer at the ministry of agriculture, the director of communications, a very hard-drinking, well-connected, Westminster operator, took me aside and gave me the most important political advice of my career: “Never lie, even if your boss tells you to and you think you can get away with it. Don’t. It’s always the lie or the cover-up that gets you in politics.” I always remembered those words, mainly because I was so scared of them. Of course, politicians, like most humans, at times sail close to the wind, and sometimes for understandable reasons – personal, security, confidentiality. But there is a dangerously relaxed approach to the truth that has infected our political discourse. I think every politician should be reminded of my old boss’s words on an annual basis. Especially when there’s a big red Brexit bus involved. Ayesha Hazarika\n",
      "Charmian Carr obituary The actor Charmian Carr, who has died from complications relating to dementia aged 73, was a supporting player who appeared in only one feature film. But that film was the perennially popular, five-Oscar-winning The Sound of Music (1965), which has attracted obsessive devotion from legions of fans. Radiating youthful charm, Carr played Liesl, the slightly rebellious oldest daughter of the Von Trapp children, all seven of whom sang and danced to Do-Re-Mi, The Lonely Goatherd and So Long, Farewell. However, it was in the duet Sixteen Going On Seventeen that Carr had a chance to shine. Liesl makes a play for Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), the blond telegram delivery boy, singing “I need someone older and wiser, Telling me what to do. You are 17 going on 18. I’ll depend on you.” When a storm breaks out, the couple shelter in a gazebo, where they dance romantically, ending with Rolfe giving Liesl a quick kiss, to her obvious delight. Carr later reprises the song in a duet with Maria (Julie Andrews), the fresh-faced singing governess. Carr was 21 going on 22 when she got the role of Liesl. She was a student attending San Fernando Valley State College, California, studying speech therapy and philosophy, and working in a lab for a doctor, as well as modelling on the side, when her mother arranged for her to audition for a role in The Sound of Music, although she had never sung or danced professionally. Yet the producer-director Robert Wise chose her over several other beginners, including Mia Farrow, Geraldine Chaplin and Teri Garr, and changed her surname from Farnon to Carr. She was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Rita Oehmen, a vaudeville performer, and Brian Farnon, a musician. Her winning the role of Liesl came after a four-month search by Wise. She could never have imagined how popular The Sound of Music was to become. With its catchy Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, the film, set in spectacular Tyrolean scenery and shot in magnificent Todd-AO and De Luxe Color, grossed $200m worldwide on its first release. More recently, since 1999, it has engendered a Sing-Along-A-Sound of Music, an interactive entertainment in which audiences dress up as characters from the film, and sing all the songs. Carr, who attended many a cast reunion, felt that singing along was a perfect therapy for people’s woes. In 1966, she co-starred with Anthony Perkins in Evening Primrose, a 60- minute musical written by Stephen Sondheim. The haunting work takes place after closing in a department store inhabited by night people, including Carr as a 19-year-old who has lived in the store since she was six. She and Perkins, as a poet seeking refuge, fall in love and attempt to escape. Carr’s poignant performance, which included singing Take Me to the World and I Remember, makes one wonder why she did not become a star. Perhaps one reason was her marriage, in 1967, to a dentist, Jay Brent, with whom she had two daughters. (They divorced in 1991.) However, she later ran an interior design firm, Charmian Carr Designs, in Encino, California. Among her faithful clients was Michael Jackson, who became a friend. She also wrote two books (co-written by Jean Strauss), Forever Liesl (2000) and Letters to Liesl (2001), inevitably dominated by her candid reminiscences of the shooting of The Sound of Music and its aftermath. In the memoirs, Carr revealed that she had a “huge crush” on Christopher Plummer, 13 years her senior, who played Captain von Trapp, her handsome widower father in the film. Carr is survived by her daughters, Jenifer and Emily. • Charmian Carr (Charmian Anne Farnon), actor, born 27 December 1942; died 17 September 2016\n",
      "Beth Orton – hear Moon, from her forthcoming album Kidsticks Beth Orton was never just your conventional singer-songwriter with an acoustic guitar and a desperate need to share. She made her name in the 90s by incorporating the electronics of dance music producers into her music. On Kidsticks, her sixth album and her first for four years, she has worked with Andrew Hung of Fuck Buttons, combining both her past and a look to the future. The origins of Kidsticks lie in the electronic loops Orton began working with when she moved to California two years ago. From that she has produced a record apparently inspired by Los Angeles as well as her early work with Andrew Weatherall, William Orbit and Kieran Hebden. We’ve got an exclusive track from Kidsticks – which is released on Anti on 27 May – for you. Have a listen to Moon and let us know what you think.\n",
      "Louis van Gaal’s time at Manchester United is surely up after new low Lads, it’s Manchester United. Or at least, it’s something that looks a bit like them, United at one remove, a United‑style product. On a chilly, slow-burn, ultimately raucous afternoon at White Hart Lane the contrast between the collection of energetically baffled red shirts currently representing English football’s champion club of the past 25 years, and the team Alex Ferguson could send out to feast on their opponents with a flick of his finger was so pronounced as to be more or less completely meaningless This was instead a kind of alternate red and white world, Manchester United glimpsed through a psychedelic prism. Weird, late, jumbled up. Expensively acquired, dotted with youth, charged with pace. But somehow also lost in their own ponderous moments, like a collection of dying flies trying to batter their way out of a fluorescent tube. There have been a few disjointed, downright odd days in the recent history of Manchester United. The competition is pretty stiff here. But this has to be up there, an afternoon to make you question not simply whether Louis van Gaal should carry on as manager of the club, but whether anything could actually be gained from getting rid of him, an existential-crisis 3-0 defeat for a United team so devoid of urgency and bite the only emotion it seems to inspire is a kind of humorous relief, a perverse kind of weirdness-fascination. United started brightly here, before descending slowly, but inevitably into entropy. No doubt in those opening 20 minutes Spurs were a little spooked by United’s late arrival for the game, the time to reflect on and digest Leicester’s victory at Sunderland , a result that took a great deal of heat out of this game. Even in victory Tottenham ended the day seven points behind. Leicester have been top or joint top on all but four Premier League weekends since the 21 November. Oh for a more open league. In effect there was more riding on this fixture for United, who came here with a fair chance of edging Manchester City for fourth place. By the end both the result and the performance felt like the final, rasping breaths of their league season that has spluttered and sparked without ever seeming to thrum into life. What now for Van Gaal, who seems to be wheeled out at the end of games such as these as much out of a perverse, vicarious fascination with what he might say next? Even for a Van Gaal sympathiser it is almost impossible to make a case for keeping him in place for the final year of his contract. Not because any team has a right to win trophies, or because it is a disgrace to come fifth in a competitive league. The positives of the Van Gaal interlude were on show here in a team containing three players aged 20 or younger. Anthony Martial might have opened the scoring here in the second half. He looks a wonderfully pure modern footballer, blessed with speed, power and driving intelligence. Timothy Fosu-Mensah is a hugely impressive teenage powerhouse, and was United’s best player until he limped off. It is simply that United continue to play with so little verve and joy. There is no sense here of a team emerging, of a shape and a purpose being found, simply of a collection of parts poking out in various places, occasionally offering the odd misleading sparkle of hope, before collapsing back into a froth of confusion. For 20 minutes Tottenham played like a team with a slow puncture. For 10 minutes midway through the second half they began to surge and swarm in familiar fashion At which point United abruptly buckled. Dele Alli had been quiet, but he was there to sweep in Christian Eriksen’s excellent cross from the left on 70 minutes. Three minutes later it was 2-0. Six minutes later it was 3-0, each goal coming from United’s right via a fairly simple cross. And suddenly United looked utterly hollowed out, bumbling, slope-shouldered, a group of players who simply no longer wanted to be there. At least at the start of the second half there was an opportunity to speculate exactly why, how, with what in mind – satire, boredom, an obscure absurdist protest at the rigidity of identity politics – Van Gaal would have decided to send on Ashley Young not as a false nine, or a deep-lying striker, but an actual lead-the-line centre forward. By the end Young had moved to right-back, Jesse Lingard had shuttled most of the way across the midfield, Juan Mata had spent an inconclusive spell filling in at right-wing, Fosu-Mensah had done a fine job winkled in at right-back. At the final whistle Van Gaal stood up as the players trooped off and ordered them down the touchline to applaud the away support. They looked more than a little surprised, but trudged over and waved a bit, to a mixed response. It was a fittingly half-cocked end to an afternoon on which the most jumbled, oddly skewed and seasick-looking United team of modern times more or less reached an end point in the Premier League season.\n",
      "Bill Ryder-Jones review – a magical talent spills melody and emotion With dishevelled clothing and hair over his eyes, Bill Ryder-Jones looks more like a sleepy teenager than a seasoned music industry veteran. However, now 32, he co-founded Wirral psychedelists the Coral aged 13, and subsequently enjoyed No 1 albums before agoraphobia and stress-related illness led to his departure from the band. Eight years on, any music business-related trauma is confined to an impishly comical tirade against the venue’s overpowering smoke machine. “Is that supposed to be on all the time, or is someone trying to kill us?” he chuckles. The rooms may be more intimate, but he is packing them out as he becomes a solo artist of considerable heft. Waterfalls of melody spill from his and Liam Power’s guitars as the band’s sound fuses Pavement’s 90s alt.grunge with the gentler Velvet Underground. His eyes in some faraway place and voice cracking with strain and emotion, Ryder-Jones’s delivery is delicately compulsive as songs from last year’s West Kirby County Primary album find magic in the everyday. “Take me somewhere I’m not likely to forget,” he sings, affectionately. “Two singles to Birkenhead.” However, few songwriters would tackle the almost unbearably raw subject matter of Daniel – about the death of Ryder-Jones’s brother, and its devastating impact on the family – let alone turn it into a song of such humbling beauty. Cheers greet the gorgeously yearning Wild Roses, before the transcendent Satellites alludes to his post-Coral breakdown and recovery: “Of all the things I’ve loved, but had to tear apart. I got lost in myself, and time got lost as well.” Perhaps music almost lost him, too, but it is graced by the return of such a magical, colossal talent. • At Stereo, Glasgow, 8 March.

      "Viola Beach's debut album tops the UK charts Viola Beach, the band who tragically died in a car crash in Sweden, have reached No 1 with their debut album. The band’s four members and their manager were killed in February when the car they were in fell from a highway bridge into a canal in Stockholm. The families and friends of the group released a self-titled collection of nine songs as a tribute to vocalist Kris Leonard, guitarist River Reeves, bassist Tomas Lowe, drummer Jack Dakin and manager Craig Tarry. In a statement, the families said: “The tragedy that ended Craig, Jack, Kris, River and Tom’s lives in Sweden and the pain and sense of loss will never leave us. By sending the Viola Beach album to Number 1 the public have sent out an important message to the world. “The tragic circumstance that met Viola Beach and their manager Craig that fateful night in Sweden will not now define their lives. What will now define their lives and what they will be remembered for, forever, is the music they were so passionate about making together.” At the time of the crash, Viola Beach were a rising guitar band steadily building a fanbase. The story of a group who never got the chance to realise their potential touched a nerve with many music fans, including Coldplay, who dedicated a section of their Glastonbury headline slot to them. Chris Martin told the crowd: “We’re going to create Viola Beach’s alternate future for them and let them headline Glastonbury with their song,” before playing Boys That Sing. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, said: “It is hard to think of an album more people were rooting for than the Viola Beach release – nor a success which has felt so bittersweet. We’re delighted that it has taken the No 1 spot, but it is an awful tragedy that Jack, Kris, River, Tomas and Craig are not here to see themselves take a place in the annals of British music.”\n",
      "Various: PC Music Volume 2 review – the smartest gang in British pop PC Music first presented its ridiculously saccharine and relentlessly weird dance-pop to the world three years ago, and were greeted with a mixture of fervour, revulsion and skepticism: was it a deliberately crap parody or digital music taken to bracing new extremes? It never quite disrupted the mainstream, but has made inroads into proper pop through collaborations with artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Charli XCX. Now, with the hype muted, this second compilation provides an opportunity to appreciate the music on its own terms – and it feels more beautiful and progressive than ever before. Highlights include Hannah Diamond and her slickly plaintive musings on online life, GFOTY introducing nu-rave and industrial influences into the PC universe, and head honcho AG Cook’s sublime postmodern pop song Superstar. The latter, which balances on a knife’s edge between sincerity and pastiche, is proof that Cook and his gang are the cleverest, most thoughtful people in British pop.\n",
      "Wide Open Sky review – Young Talent Time goes bush in a charming documentary Lisa Nicol’s modestly charming documentary Wide Open Sky takes some potshots at the Australian education system for its general emphasis of sport over music. But from a cinematic point of view, when it comes to narrative structure and key themes there is usually not a great deal that differentiates feel-good films focused on either pastime – particularly when it comes to stories propelled by young participants. Youth-oriented music or sports films with a group dynamic (think School of Rock or The Mighty Ducks) often take the form of triumph-of-the-underdog tales. You know the kind: a motley array of personalities band together and work hard en route to a big public performance, like a grand final or a concert, where heart-on-sleeve emotions shoot for the bleachers. Wide Open Sky reminds us this is as much a feature film concept as one equally conducive to documentary. Nicol directs a sort of Mrs Carey’s Concert on wheels (or Young Talent Time gone bush) with private school city slickers swapped out for children from disadvantaged rural locations. The film-maker goes off-road into remote New South Wales to follow the annual recruitment process of conductor and music teacher Michelle Leonard, a pragmatic, inspirational figure who commands an army of singing pipsqueaks. Every year Leonard journeys 4,000km to audition 2,000 children from 55 schools, selecting 13 to join her Moorambilla Voices choir. The chosen few attend a three-day training camp in Baradine, where Leonard gives their vocal cords a work out and preps them for a one-night-only performance at a music festival in Coonamble. There’s a lot of “repeat after me” sessions, during which intensely focused li’l tykes stretch their mouths and contort their young faces to hit the right notes. Presumably a number of clips from the film will resurface at 21st birthday parties. One choir member, Opal, announces to the camera her ideal future: “When I’m older I’d like to be a singer and a naturalist.” Like a lot of docos where children are encouraged to speak candidly, Wide Open Sky has a whiff of Kids Say the Darndest Things. Also of the 1972 outback tournament movie Sunstruck, about a teacher who recruits a choir of bumpkin shoe-size-exceeds-their-age amateurs and takes them to Sydney to compete in a talent show at the Opera House. You get a feel for Wide Open Road pretty quick: it’s sweet, slight and good-natured to the core. Hardly riveting or must-watch material but equally difficult to hate. Like the kid-oriented Australian documentaries Gayby Baby and I Am Eleven, the film probably works best as a perspective-widening educational package informing children of other young lives whose cultural and socioeconomic circumstances differ from their own. Even if – unlike, say, the bling-lathered That Sugar Film – its no-frills vanilla aesthetic suggests the look and feel of it has not necessarily been tailor-made for them. Leonard reveals, in a moment given only cursory consideration, that she doesn’t have proper financial support for her altruistic initiative, implying something of a shit fight when it comes to extracting enough money to make the singathong possible year-on-year. Perhaps this also poses the question of whether Wide Open Sky is actually some kind of elaborate exercise in support, or even fundraising. If so, what the hell – only a hard heart wouldn’t want to throw a coin or two in the tin. • Wide Open Sky is showing in Australia now\n",
      "Desert Trip festival reportedly sells out in less than three hours The Desert Trip festival – featuring the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Roger Waters and the Who – sold out all its 70,000 three-day tickets for each of the festival’s two weekends in under three hours, Billboard reports. Although the festival’s organisers – Goldenvoice and AEG z – have not made an official announcement about how quickly all tickets for the event have sold, Billboard reports that its sources say both Desert Trip weekends – 9-11 October and 16-18 October – sold out in less than three hours. Billboard estimates the gross revenues from ticket sales at $150m (£104m). Last year’s highest grossing festival was Coachella – run by the same people who are putting on Desert Trip, on the same site near Palm Springs, California – which made $84.26m over two weekends, according to Forbes. Desert Trip would be, comfortably, the highest-grossing event in music history. As well as ticket sales, the organisers will be making money from ancillary activities such as selling licenses for catering and luxury camping. Desert Trip promises “over 30 culinary masterminds” providing food, as well as assorted catering packages starting at $129 per person per day. Desert Trip, with its likely appeal to a prosperous audience of baby boomers, has charged premium prices. The 35,000 reserved seats for each weekend sold for between $699 and $1,599, while general admission was $399. The last tickets to sell out were the $199 day passes. However, the cost of booking the six acts who are appearing would have been colossal. One source familiar with the logistics of booking huge acts, and who had worked with some of those appearing at Desert Trip, suggested to the that Desert Trip might well be paying between $6m and $9m to each of the six acts.\n",
      "£24k for an Adele ticket? But there could be a bargain in the next seat A rather apocalyptic report in the on Sunday noted how much one might pay to get tickets for Adele’s UK tour. It found that you could be charged up to £24,000 to see the superstar at the O2 in London, if you went through “secondary ticketing sites”. That was true. There were sellers asking those prices, but that doesn’t reflect the whole picture. Get Me In, the site that was – alas no longer; the listing has disappeared – offering four seats in row R of the top tier of the O2 for £22,000 each plus fees, also has tickets a couple of rows further forward for £180 each. It has tickets in block A3 – the seating block on the floor in front of the stage – for £2,750. That’s not meant to excuse those prices. They are horrific. The secondary ticket sites (where people resell tickets they have already bought, for events they can’t go to, often discovering they can’t go just seconds after buying the tickets, incredibly) have succeeded in turning touting into a leisure activity: lots of people now think nothing of buying an extra ticket or two and then offsetting the cost of their own attendance against the profit from tickets they resell. Worse still, secondary ticketing sites have become havens for organised touts, who’ve found ways around the flimsy security devices intended to deter them. What’s worse, plenty are engaging in what’s known as “speculative ticketing” – copying one of the less attractive practices of City trading by selling something they don’t have, in the hope that before the event comes, they’ll be able to buy the ticket they are advertising at a price less than they are selling for. If they can’t do that, of course, the secondary buyer never gets the ticket. It’s not really a surprise to learn that the Association of Chief Police Officers believes organised crime gangs are active in the secondary ticketing market, given the ease with which it’s possible to make a fortune. The government has also launched a review of the secondary ticketing market. Ticketmaster – which owns Get Me In and Seatwave – offered this defence: “Ticketing marketplaces react to demand and the willingness of fans to pay. With high-profile events, such as Adele, tickets are sometimes listed at prices higher than the face value. Tickets very rarely sell at these elevated prices though, with many selling at face value or below the original price.” What that means is that tickets for sold-out shows will go for more than face price, while tickets for shows that don’t sell out might go for less than face price. That doesn’t mean you’ll be able to get the best seats in the house for half price, mind you – if all the premium seats are gone, you’ll still have to pay through the nose. But if there are plenty of rubbish seats left at the box office, you might get them cheaply through a secondary seller. But the point about secondary ticket prices responding to demand is absolutely correct. The people who are charging a fortune for terrible tickets, having set the prices themselves, are either a) trolls b) misreading the markets or c) not expecting anyone to buy the tickets until the very last minute, when all other options have disappeared, and the only way someone with a great deal of money can get to see the show is if they are willing to be taken to the cleaners. It is routinely the case that when you see a ticket being sold for a truly eye-watering price, one that stretches credulity, then you will find a seat of similar quality for very much cheaper. It doesn’t make it right – I find the secondary ticketing business reprehensible, which is why I’ve always refused to do PR-driven interviews with the big players at any of the companies (they are offered frequently; these people are well aware of how bad they look when a story like the Adele tickets breaks) – but it’s important to remember that the headline price you might see offered isn’t the definitive price, it’s one price. How the big summer show prices compare on the big resale sites Beyoncé The cheapest seat we found for any of Beyoncé’s UK dates on Viagogo was £75.90, to sit in row 19 of block 519 at Wembley Stadium on 3 July – on the top tier, in the furthest corner from the stage. That’s to sit in a seat from which Beyoncé will be little more than a rumour. The most expensive was £12,101, for row 7 of block 520 on 2 July – another terrible seat, and the worst value we found. Leaving that one aside, it was a £10,000 drop to the next most expensive seats: £2,300 for block 206 was still awful value, given that while lower down, it’s still a long way from the stage, especially when £2,250 would buy you a “Beyhive” package with a standing place at the very front of the stage. Seatwave was much the same, with a cheapest ticket of £80 for block 516 of Wembley on 3 July, and a priciest one of £1,500 for Old Trafford cricket ground on 5 July, in its “The Point” section. Though that looks badly overpriced when you can still buy the top hospitality package for The Point for £375 for that show. Give it a couple of months. It’s the same story at the cheap end for Get Me In (£75.99 for block 526 at Wembley on 3 July), while its most expensive is an optimistic £5,500 to stand in the golden circle at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light on 28 June. You can get the same ticket, for the same show, on the same site, for £550. Stubhub has Wembley top tier seats for £75, with a Beyhive package topping the price list at £2,250 – how interesting that it’s the same price as on Viagogo. There’s also a general admission standing ticket for £2,500. That’s to stand miles away from the stage with no golden circle or Beyhive privileges. Coldplay Things are much the same at the bottom end for Coldplay – all four of the big resellers have their cheapest offers for seats in Wembley’s top tier, and all for the band’s show on 15 June (one of four Wembley gigs they are playing), with prices ranging from £70.91 (Viagogo) to £81.99 (Seatwave and Stubhub). At the other end of the scale, for three of the sites, the most expensive tickets are for the band’s gig at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on 4 June. Viagogo is offering a “VIP pass” for block 204 – second tier, decent position relative to the stage – for £900. The same block with no pass is £1,023.75 on Seatwave, and £1,320 on Get Me In. The most most expensive Stubhub seat for Wembley is £1,300 for block 227 of the Club Wembley tier – a decent seat, but not £1,300 worth of decent seat.\n",
      "BHS inquiry, act III: enter the bankers and lawyers Goldman Sachs merely had a walk-on role in the great BHS sale giveaway, but Sir Philip Green should have listened more closely to Anthony Gutman, his old mucker from the investment bank. Gutman seems to have taken about two minutes to spot the obvious flaw in selling BHS, a loss-making chain of department stores with 11,000 staff and 20,000 pensioners, to Retail Acquisitions: the outfit was led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt individual with no retail experience waving a sketchy business plan. Gutman did the sensible thing and flagged his worries to Paul Budge, finance director of Green’s Arcadia group. The rest of the saga seems to have been a tale of the various other parties – lawyers, Arcadia’s management – convincing themselves that Chappell’s past bankruptcies were not a deal-breaker, or else were somebody else’s lookout. Monday’s select committee session heard a Linklaters partner deliver an effective hatchet job on his counterpart at Olswang, the lawyers acting for Chappell and thus the firm responsible for checking their client’s credentials. Olswang’s version of its fact-finding efforts is keenly awaited. For his part Budge pointed to the experienced and competent folk who later surrounded Chappell, including advisers Grant Thornton who were all over his business plan “like a rash”. Besides, argued Budge, Arcadia gifted Retail Acquisitions a load of cash and working capital to have a good crack at a turnaround. It was all fascinating detail. None of it, however, changes the central fact that Green was taking a huge risk in selling BHS to Chappell’s bunch of amateurs. On Monday’s evidence, Green’s moral obligation to do the right thing for BHS’s pensioners remains. Biggest cash takeover in history? Bayer beware A $62bn (£43bn) cash bid should be contemplated only if you can be confident you’ve got – or can secure – the backing of your shareholders. Bayer chief executive Werner Baumann, in pursuit of US seeds business Monsanto, isn’t remotely able to make this claim. Bayer’s share price has fallen 14% since news of the adventure broke, and Monday’s confirmed bid price – $122 a share, or a 37% premium to Monsanto’s old share price – will do little to calm investors’ nerves. Naturally, Baumann was full of smooth talk about how Bayer’s pesticides and Monsanto’s genetically modified seeds would create “a global leader in agriculture”, spread joy among the world’s farmers and deliver an instant kick to earnings. “Arrogant empire-building” that will destroy shareholder value, reckoned fund manager Henderson Global Investors’ John Bennett. That sounds closer to the mark. First, Bayer would be stretching its balance sheet to the limit. Even after whacking shareholders with a hefty rights issue, Bayer’s debt would sail past four times’ top-line annual earnings. Such financial leverage flatters earnings per share, assuming all goes well, but taking on €55bn-plus of debt is not without risk. Second, annual “synergies” of $1.5bn in the third years don’t look large in the context of the size of the deal. Third, any hopes of Bayer’s expanding its pharmaceutical division would be on hold while it sweats off the Monsanto debt; given that many investors think prospects in pharma are stronger, that’s a serious drawback. Fourth, there’s the mystery factor of whether US competition regulators would allow one company to be so dominant in the US agriculture business. If it happens Bayer/Monsanto would be the biggest cash takeover in history. On day one, Baumann is struggling. Every little trip hurts Taxi for Mr Higgins. Actually, no, it seems Tesco is gloriously relaxed about Benny Higgins, boss of its Edinburgh-based bank, running up a London taxi bill of £18,000 in just eight months, as revealed in Saturday’s . Higgins is still in his post, says a company spokesman, declining to elaborate on the mundane statement that “all Tesco colleagues adhere to a clear policy that allows travel and other expenses for business reasons”. So no explanation as to why it is OK to claim £389.85 for a trip from Soho Hotel to the Victoria & Albert museum, just five stops away on the underground. And no explanation as to how Higgins’ liberal use of taxis squares with the parsimonious approach taken by group chief executive Dave Lewis, who likes to parade the fact he takes the train to London from the Hertfordshire head office to save money and keep a checkout worker in employment. In the grand scheme of things, an £18,000 taxi bill doesn’t move the profits dial at a company the size of Tesco. But, to judge by the sickly share price, it won’t be long before Lewis is firing off another of his uplifting all-staff emails about the urgent need to pull together as “a total Tesco team”. Good luck in explaining to staff why the daughters of your £2m-a-year banking executive are transported to the airport apparently at the company’s expense.\n",
      "SXSW: John Legend goes down smooth and Rae Sremmurd delivers rowdy trap After a dispiriting morning watching Tony Visconti give an impression of an old man yelling at clouds in his keynote speech which basically said that the music industry is screwed, something uplifting was needed. It was time to head to the space in Austin, Texas co-sponsored by Spin magazine and Axe, the kind of deoderant worn by teenage boys. Into this unpromising environment came John Legend, who took his seat at a grand piano set on stage at one end of a courtyard and performed a handful of numbers solo. Legend’s melismatic R&B will never been anywhere near music’s cutting edge – and arguably it’s a lot less interesting than his politically savvy Twitter feed – but on a sticky St Patrick’s Day afternoon, a swirling take on Green Light goes down like a cold Guinness. It’s followed by Ordinary People (“some of y’all were 10 when it came out,” notes Legend), which inspires a spontaneous audience singalong. Suave and smiley, Legend is a winning presence, and while his version of Bob Marley’s Redemption Song has none of the rawness of the original, it’s smoothness doesn’t make it any less sincere. With an announcement that he has a new album coming out in September, and a shamelessly slushy All of Me to conclude, Legend leaves the crowd sweaty enough to require some of that deodorant – even if the free sticks being given away are scented with “amber and tobacco”. Over at the Fader Fort, sponsored by another music magazine and a bewildering number of other brands, the audience is showing admirable restraint in the face of a bar giving out free Jack Daniels, and enjoying a bill that prides itself on its diversity. Neon Indian takes the stage, aka Mexican-born local boy Alan Palomo, whose Todd Rundgren-inspired chillwave has evolved into something even more colourfully 80s-tinged – think Prince jamming with Discovery-era Daft Punk. The first song is decorated with the kind of drums Sheila E used to play in Prince’s band the Revolution, while Annie dares to approach that most toxic of genres, white reggae, but with a playfulness that prevents it from being obnoxious. Slumlord, which begins with a ridiculously dramatic synth flourish, has a glossy bounce that sends some in the crowd into paroxisms of delight. It’s euphoric, slightly arch, clever pop and Palomo is an enjoyably daft presence with his knock-kneed Matt Bianco dance moves and luxuriantly cascading fringe. It’s quite a transition from that to the fratboy-friendly trap exuberantly purveyed by Atlanta duo Rae Sremmurd. Stripped to the waist, covered in tattoos and headbanging harder than Slayer, it’s a total rock’n’roll show, assisted by the regulation posse including one man wandering around in a cherry MIA jacket and bulging floral backpack. With their songs about strippers (Come Get Her), getting too “swoll” (No Flex Zone) and dodgy exes (My X) there’s nothing exactly groundbreaking going on, but it is a lot of fun. The concluding No Type (“Bad bitches is the only thing that I like,” it elaborates) provokes a cascade of free Jack and Cokes to be launched into the air, while their ode to Donald Trump, Up Like Trump, concludes with an appeal to the crowd to vote for Bernie Sanders. Rowdy, funny and packed with energy, it’s the perfect late-afternoon set. Hearing the rapid-fire, pounding sounds of Jlin’s take on Chicago footwork as the sun streamed into the Hype Hotel was strange. Tracks like Abnormal Restriction from last year’s well-received Dark Energy bounced around the cavenous hall with the unsettling samples from Joan Crawford biopic Mommie Dearest combining with the instrumentation to make things unnerving. Jlin’s palette is varied and although things moved along at the 160 bpm that footwork is known for, within those parameters Jlin has found spaces to explore and develop. When she played Black Ballet – arguably the best track from Dark Energy – there’s a noticeable shift in the room with the half a dozen or so fans who were head banging from the first snare, now swaying from side to side. A later billing in darker room probably would have benefited Jlin, but it was still a showcase of a singular talent. DAWN (formerly Dawn Richard) followed Jlin and brought with her a slick and polished show that saw her meld electronica, R&B and techno. She’s been working with footwork producer Machinedrum (Not Above That) and her sound has morphed into something that’s got an eye on the dancefloor. The live show itself features two male dancers in all black and ab-baring crop tops who perform choreography that recalls early Janet Jackson, while Richard commands the stage and nods approvingly at her drummer and keyboard player. It’s an interesting proposition, but when she plays a cover of Rihanna’s Work the gulf in songwriting is apparent. Nothing really jumps out of the Richard repertoire and in the short show, there’s not enough stand out hooks or moments to draw you in. Kacey Musgraves was the first country star to ever grace the cover of Fader, a magazine that’s known for its courtship of rap and R&B’s biggest stars. At the Fader Fort she closed the show on Thursday. The crowd, which had been bulging and riotous for Rae Sremmurd, has now calmed and more than half the audience had left by the time Musgraves came on. But that didn’t kill the atmosphere, instead it felt like an intimate show with the singer and her band – who were doused in glitter – playing to a dedicated audience. Slower rancheras were followed by bigger hits including Step Off and a cover of Gnarls Barkley. There was a segue into a cod reggae version of Three Little Birds before she played her hit Late To The Party and her defiant anthem Follow Your Arrow. She closed the show with a cover of Nancy Sinatra’s and Lee Hazlewood’s classic These Boots Are Made For Walkin’ before striding off herself. Toronto’s Dilly Dally played Hype Hotel in the evening and delivered their brazenly scuzzy punk rock wares. There’s plenty of charm from frontwoman Katie Monks, who screeches and wails her way through the bands Pixies-esque single Desire. Like the Pixies, Dilly Dally mix loud and quiet and go as far to play their cover of fellow Torontonian Drake’s Know Yourself. Rather than drenching it in a load of feedback, they keep the melancholy tale of counting money and driving through Toronto clean and just turn up the volume on the chorus. Recent single Purple Rage rattles through the venue and shows off a punk band that know when to hold a tune and when to distort it beyond all recognition.\n",
      "Nissan got a sweetheart deal. Under hard Brexit, everyone will want one Welcome to the wonderful world of Brexit PLC: a nod here, a wink there, something under the counter and “I-don’t-mind-if-I-do”. No one knows, yet, what a government minister or official said to the Japanese company Nissan, to secure a massive new investment in Britain’s biggest car plant in Sunderland. We can only be sure it is neither the first nor the last. As Theresa May’s government steers its unsteady course between the shoals of soft Brexit and the storms of hard, it assures all and sundry that everything will be fine on the night. But harsh business reality is immune to the cliches of political spin. Nissan has to make a decision now on a planned 2018 investment for its new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV vehicles. Vague assurances would not do. This was hard cash and 7,000 jobs, threatened by a double-figure tariff on trade with Europe under “hard Brexit”. The idea that industry minister Greg Clark could have got away with “just trust me” is ludicrous. Clark’s reported guarantee of continuing “competitiveness”, plus subsidies for training and other forms of job support, must have been expressed in bankable terms. Similar deals are rumoured to be busting out all over Planet Brexit. The farmers have allegedly been given assurances that the migrant worker schemes on which their harvests depend will be protected. The big banks are told over ministerial lunches there is no question of obstacles to the free movement of their staffs round Europe. Care homes, NHS hospitals, the construction industry, tourism are all beating paths to Whitehall’s doors, relying as they do on low-paid continental and seasonal labour. Within the car industry, it goes without saying that Toyota, Ford and other big manufacturers are awaiting the same soothing words as Nissan has received. Otherwise all hell will break loose. The British government complains when international companies are offered sweetheart deals from Ireland, Luxembourg or Monaco. When investment becomes a free-for-all, there is a rush to the bottom. Countries compete with each other, either to subsidise business or – the same thing – to excuse them taxes or compensate them for tariffs. The prospect under a “hard” Brexit, and a reversion to World Trade Organisation tariffs, would result in myriad such deals, day in, day out. And when clout is the issue, one thing is for sure: the smaller the business the less clout. Ever since the industrial revolution, free trade has been one of the greatest boons that politics has brought to mankind. The idea that it should start to unravel within the European cradle of that revolution is appalling. Soft Brexit is a no-brainer. Britain has to trade openly with Europe and Europe with Britain.\n",
      "The Anchoress: Confessions of a Romance Novelist review – a rich and complex debut The richness of this debut album from Welsh singer-songwriter Catherine Anne Davies betrays its years in the making, through griefs, injuries and heartbreaks paid wry tribute to in the darkly dreamy 70s pop of Doesn’t Kill You. Styles from the romping Kate Bushisms of Popular to the Princely post-punk of One for Sorrow are stitched together by the theme of the titular “second-rate writer”, sketching portraits of bitter ex-lovers in the likes of PS Fuck You, sending up confessional singer-songwriterdom at the same time as crafting a blackly witty breakup album. That concept could come through more clearly, and on the slower, heavier piano ballads such as Bury Me, the drama of Davies’s gothic Broadway stylings can grow suffocating, but her vengeful vision remains compelling.\n",
      "David Bowie's Blackstar sales soar as tribute shows announced Sales of David Bowie’s final album, Blackstar, have soared after the singer’s death, as a series of tribute shows and memorial events in his honour were announced. Sales and downloads of Blackstar, released on the singer’s 69th birthday two days before he died, have reached 43,000 in the UK in the 24 hours since the news of Bowie’s death shook the world. The critically acclaimed album, described by his long-term producer and friend Tony Visconti as Bowie’s “parting gift”, has also topped the iTunes charts, and more than half of the UK’s top 40 chart has been taken up by albums from Bowie’s back catalogue. Spotify has reported that global streams of Bowie’s music were up by 2,822% since Monday – totalling more than 6.5m listens – and Life on Mars, Heroes, Let’s Dance and Blackstar have entered the site’s top 10 chart. It was announced on Tuesday that a tribute would be paid to Bowie at the Brit awards in February, celebrating what the chairman, Max Lousada, described as the “extraordinary life and work of one of our greatest icons”. New York’s Carnegie hall will also host a memorial concert on 31 March. The show, announced hours before Bowie’s death, was originally scheduled as a tribute with performances of the singer’s hit songs by Visconti, Cyndi Lauper, and The Roots among others. But the event that organisers spent the last seven months planningwill now memorialise Bowie’s life and his influence on music. “This year’s concert will certainly be remembered as a poignant celebration of his music by his friends, peers, and fans,” a statement on the organisers’ website said. “The show is taking on many more emotions. RIP David and may God’s love be with you.” Bowie died age 69 after suffering from cancer for 18 months. Notoriously private, Bowie kept his illness a secret until the end, only letting a small inner circle know of his diagnosis. The musicians who worked with Bowie on jazz-inspired Blackstar have said they had no idea the musician was ill, and Bowie’s family have chosen not to confirm what type of cancer he had, the circumstances around his death or where he died. The family have also requested that those close to Bowie do not give interviews. It is thought the Brixton-born singer’s funeral will be held in New York, where he moved to in 1993 after marrying his second wife, Iman, and where they raised their daughter, Alexandria. Visconti’s supergroup, Holy Holy, which also features Bowie’s Spiders From Mars drummer Woody Woodmansey, will also perform two tribute shows to Bowie on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Toronto Opera House. Ivo van Hove, director of Bowie’s musical Lazarus, was one of the few people Bowie had informed of his illness, in November 2014, to explain why he would not be able to attend all rehearsals. The singer had asked that van Hove keep the information to himself. The director said Bowie had “fought like a lion” through his illness and had been determined to keep working to the end. Speaking about Lazarus rehearsals, Van Hove told the New York Times that Bowie came “whenever he could”. He said: “Sometimes he sent me an email – ‘I’ve had a bad day’ – but he was very close to the whole process.” The director said that on the production’s opening night last month, the last time the singer was seen in public, Bowie had seemed very frail, adding: “I felt it deeply, that this would be the last time I see him.”\n",
      "Henry Wagons: After What I Did Last Night … – exclusive album stream It’s a cliche to compare every male Australian singer with a deep timbre to Nick Cave, but there’s something appealing in the idea of a Cave in cowboy boots – an alternative-universe country Cave who found redemption not in gothic post-punk but in winding tales of high melodrama and the twang of Nashville guitar. Meet Henry Wagons, a musician Justin Townes Earle has described as “Dr Seuss meets Conway Twitty”. After more than a decade of touring and recording with his band Wagons (Cave, in fact, co-produced their 2014 album Acid Rain and Sugar Cane), Henry is releasing a solo album – an autobiography of songs that spans his life so far, from a rowdy misspent youth to a stint as a tour-hardened troubadour, to his latest role as a new father. To record After What I Did Last Night…, Wagons headed to Nashville, the home of country music, where he worked with producer Skylar Wilson. “So many of my favourite albums have been made in Tennessee with sort of pick-up studio musicians,” Wagons says. “And over my many years of going there, I’ve gotten drunk enough at bars there to have met some great musicians. Basically, it was great to be able to rock up and do the same process as so many of my favourite albums, from [Bob Dylan’s] Blonde on Blonde to [Neil Young’s] Harvest.” Wagons says he’s hooked on the city. “Good burgers on tap, fine bourbons and American accents, Southern gentlemen, kind manners and long stories,” he says. “I suspect I’ll be over to the States again to record one day soon.”\n",
      "Kids in Love review – gap-year angst This fatuous coming-of-age drama plays out like an advertisement for entitlement.

A tourist in this world of privilege, Jack is fascinated, until he gets his visa revoked and financial reality bites. It’s staggeringly shallow stuff.\n",
      "Dispatch from Myrtle Beach: Trump ignites rally, Cruz tastes the offseason Broadway Louie’s in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, 11pm on a Wednesday: there’s a man singing Sir Mix A Lot’s Baby Got Back, and two women dancing with vigor nearby. I was in town to attend Donald Trump and Ted Cruz’s respective campaign events, which both took place on Friday morning. I’d arrived early to soak up some culture, to provide some context. What would happen when the billionaire collided with the senator here, a city of jet ski shows and afternoons on inner tubes, of biker rallies and a reputation for the real spring break experience? I’ve seen films. I know how it works. I wanted to drink Bud Light in a rowdy bar. I wanted to wear wraparound shades on the top of my head. I wanted to punch a dweeb in the face and then dive-bomb into a pool. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump’s dueling campaigns had given me my chance. On Friday morning, Cruz seemed ready to get into the spirit of the town. He showed up with his favorite bro, Phil “Duck Dynasty” Robertson. The crowd was less into it. Cruz told them that last week’s debate had revealed personalities. He tried out a call-and-response with the audience. Cruz: “Who’s best prepared to be commander in chief?” Crowd: an awkward silence. Then about five people shouted: “Ted Cruz.” An elderly woman was loudest. The lackluster atmosphere spread beyond Cruz’s rally. On my Wednesday night out I had discovered that Myrtle Beach is deathly quiet in February, with plenty of Bud Light but nobody to drink it. There weren’t any rowdy bars or wraparound shades or compliant dweebs. The man and women performing Baby Got Back, for example, were in town for a leadership conference. I wanted to find people other than aspiring management executives – maybe even some voters – so I dipped out of Broadway Louie’s. A bunch of other bars nearby line the faux downtown area: cobbled streets, old-timey buildings with balconies. Then I found Señor Frogs, a chain restaurant and bar; I hastened inside. “It’s offseason,” the bartender told me. There were four of us, including the bartender. I ordered a Bud Light. This didn’t feel like the full Myrtle Beach experience. When Donald Trump swept through Myrtle on Friday he probably missed the quiet melancholy that pervades the tourist town in the offseason. Hundreds of people lined up for Trump’s event, in a queue that wrapped around the venue and two artificial lakes. There were thousands more inside. An attendee named Bill was wearing a hard hat and a high visibility vest, and held a sign saying: “I’m ready to work on the wall.” There were cheers as Trump came out on stage. The billionaire called Ted Cruz “the biggest liar I’ve ever seen”. Trump alluded to a picture that the Cruz campaign doctored, appearing to show rival Marco Rubio shaking hands with Barack Obama. He mocked their photoshopping skills. “I’m not sticking up for Marco Rubio but I looked at this picture: Marco Rubio looked like he was about four feet tall,” Trump said. “I never saw anything like it.” A little later on some protesters started shouting something. “Get them out! Get them out!” Trump shouted back. “Don’t hurt them but get them out.” Trump also seemed to dismiss his feud with Pope Francis. “The pope is great, he made a beautiful statement this morning,” Trump said. “They had him convinced that illegal immigration is a wonderful thing,” he added, implying a reference to the pope’s Mexican hosts. “Not wonderful for us, it’s wonderful for Mexico.” But Cruz got a taste of the offseason at his rally, no thanks to his pal Robertson. You’d have thought a “duck commander” would give an uplifting intro to his favorite senator, but instead Robertson whipped out a Bible and railed against everything Myrtle Beach stands for – venereal disease, especially. Sex should be reserved for marriage, he said. Between one man and one woman. “Then you won’t get a debilitating disease.” There are “110 million Americans with STDs at any given time”, he added, harshing the already fragile spring-break vibe. Finally Cruz came out. “Just imagine for a second: Phil Robertson, ambassador to the United Nations,” the senator said. I think it was a joke. Then Cruz got fired up. Very fired up. He lamented the death of Antonin Scalia. It made this election all the more important, he said. “One more justice on the left and the second amendment is written out of the bill of rights. One more justice on the left and our religious liberty is gone for a generation,” Cruz shouted, with a clenched fist. He sounded like he was ready to grab his musket and charge at Washington DC, or Hillary Clinton, or any dweeb at the party who couldn’t tell Creed from real Christian rock. “Nobody here should be confused what we are fighting for,” Cruz summarized. “We are fighting for the rights of our children and grandchildren.” But neither Cruz nor Trump had excited the gang of revelers I met on Wednesday. Paula Davis and Carol Martinelli, on a “girls’ night out”, for instance, didn’t know either candidate would be in town. “I liked Trump until he opened his mouth,” Martinelli said. What came out of Trump’s mouth? “Pretty much shit,” she said. “We’re a joke to other countries,” Davis said. Back inside Louie’s, which seemed to be the only bar in Myrtle Beach with more than 10 people, a woman gave a rousing rendition of Bon Jovi’s Livin’ on a Prayer. She wore a sash saying “40 looks good”. Her name was Nesha Madox, and she had travelled to Myrtle Beach from Charlotte “to party”. “I’m scared,” she said, when asked about the election. “There’s no strong candidate. They’re so divisive.” I asked Madox who she thought was divisive. She said Donald Trump. “The way he speaks, I genuinely don’t believe he means what he says. But the way he says it, people who have hatred seize upon it,” she said. “He’s dividing the country.” Madox returned to partying and I went for a walk around Louie’s. The man who had been singing Baby Got Back was called Tiger. He was 37. “A lot of [the election] is pretty comical,” he said. “Some of the things these guys are out here saying, it’s pretty reckless.” “The Trumps and others who are fearmongering … we’re better than that as a nation, as people,” Tiger said. I asked him what was important in this election. “Minimum wage is a big issue,” he said. “Republicans are in favor of leaving it where it is. The reality is that a person working a full-time job on minimum wage, they are below the poverty line.” I could feel the Bud Light kicking in. A woman called Melissa came over at the bar and ordered a pint of Stella Artois. “I find politics so exhausting that I would rather crawl up in the fetal position and sleep right through it,” Melissa said. She said she worked for a “big” insurance company. “Can’t we talk about something more fun?” Melissa asked. She showed me a picture of her dog, a pug called Rooney, named after Dan Rooney, the chairman and owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. She wrote “Donald Trump sucks” in my notepad and stole a pin badge I was wearing. I left at 1am. It was not a classic Myrtle Beach party experience. Neither I nor anyone else was socked in the jaw. I never met anyone wearing wraparound shades, failed to dive-bomb into a pool, and didn’t get up to any high jinks at all. “But,” I thought, as I wobbled back towards a brightly lit building that looked like it might be my hotel, “Is that such a bad thing?”\n",
      "Live music booking now Despite the revival hype, most of grime’s old guard never actually went anywhere. Kano is one such artist who has been plugging away (albeit punctuated by a high-profile acting stint on Channel 4’s brilliant Top Boy) just above street level since his mid-00s heyday. He’s found the spotlight again now, though, collaborating with Little Simz, JME and Giggs in recent months, and will embark on a string of dates to coincide with upcoming fifth album Made In The Manor (16-26 Mar, tour starts Concorde 2, Brighton) … Meanwhile, fellow grime stalwart Big Narstie plays London next month (O2 Academy2 Islington, N1, 24 Feb) … Antony Hegarty is soon to release a new album under new moniker ANOHNI, entitled Hopelessness. A collaboration with Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke, it has some accompanying Barbican dates, during which ANOHNI will be “performing embodied within a live avatar”, whatever that means (7 & 8 Jul, EC1) … Finally, anti-socialite, new pop hope and general breath of fresh air Alessia Cara briefly tours the UK (23-25 Mar, tour starts Electric Brixton, SW2).\n",
      "Soft Hair: Soft Hair review – Connan Mockasin and LA Priest do icky sex-pop Connan Mockasin and LA Priest make some of the most peculiar modern-day pop-funk, and so a collaboration was always going to be oddball. Together, they present an Iggy and Bowie-ish pairing, except with trembling falsetto, dolphin mating sounds and rippling electronic effects. But it’s unclear whether they are sending up macho male sexuality by contrasting pervy lyrics with their wimpy bare chests and luscious locks, or just using their “weirdos, us!” image as an excuse to be a bit Bloodhound Gang. Relaxed Lizard sets out their stall with slippery psychedelic pop, as Mockasin rebuffs a younger love interest (“I’d love to fuck you but I’m older …”). In Love is their answer to Iggy’s Tiny Girls, its submerged sax not quite matching Bowie’s arrangement, but the lyrics about fancying “Japanese/Chinese girls” living up to its grim message. Lying Has to Stop strikes a better balance, where silly tales of “babes and wine” and how they’ll “never touch your bum” meet loopy synths, cooing and groovy underwater whammy effects. Delightfully weird and yet unmistakably icky.\n",
      "Taylor Swift wins best pop vocal album award at Grammys 2016 for 1989 Taylor Swift’s 1989 has won the 2016 Grammy award for best pop vocal album. 1989 was Swift’s fifth studio album, and one that saw her complete the transition from country star to fully-fledged mainstream pop act. It reached the top of the charts in numerous countries, including the US and UK. Writing in the , Alexis Petridis said: “As a songwriter, Swift has a keen grasp both of her audience and of pop history. She avoids the usual hollow platitudes about self-empowerment and meaningless aspirational guff about the VIP area in the club in favour of Springsteenesque narratives of escape and the kind of doomed romantic fatalism in which 60s girl groups dealt.” Swift’s album triumphed in a group that also featured Piece By Piece by Kelly Clarkson, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful by Florence + the Machine, Uptown Special by Mark Ronson, and Before This World by James Taylor. Best pop vocal album was one of seven nominations for Swift at this year’s awards, including a song of the year nod for Blank Space, which she co-wrote with Max Martin and Shellback.\n",
      "Randy Lerner’s Aston Villa head for relegation woefully unprepared It’s brutal, relegation. If you follow a team the chances are you have suffered it at some point or another and, as Aston Villa’s supporters can probably testify, it does not matter how prepared you think you might be, or how many times it might have happened in the past, it is still a desperately numbing feeling when the guillotine falls and the players are wandering around, like zombies, not knowing where to rest their eyes. “I’ve seen childbirth twice and relegation five times,” Pete May, the author of several books on West Ham, once wrote. “Childbirth does look very painful but it lasts only a few hours. The pain of relegation lasts all summer and beyond. Plus childbirth at least results in something positive. With relegation, you’re always worried that it’s going to get worse.” It often does, as Leicester City can corroborate bearing in mind the previous ordeals encountered by the champions-in-waiting and what those experiences tell Villa about the potential for more unravelling. Leicester’s last demotion from the Premier League, in 2004, was followed by successive finishes of 15th, 16th and 19th in the Championship and then another deterioration in their fourth season at that level – to 22nd and a place in League One. Nottingham Forest have spent time in the third best division in English football or, put another way, the second worst. Leeds United have been down there and David Bernstein, one of the executives Villa have hired to try to halt the downward spiral, will know the dangers from first-hand experience if we go back to his days as Manchester City chairman and an era of Richard Edghill, Ged Brannan and Lee Bradbury rather than Vincent Kompany, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero. City went two leagues down before coming back up and when the fingers of relegation closed around their neck for a second time the Manchester Evening News carried a photograph of a young supporter wiping away tears with a flag. Bernstein asked for a copy of that picture and hung it in the boardroom at Maine Road. It was a reminder, he used to tell guests, that the club must never put their fans through the same again. Bernstein also wrote to the club’s season-ticket holders to apologise – which is the least that Villa should be doing – while City, the official club magazine, attempted to lift the mood in an article entitled: “Reasons to be cheerful”. These included “fun weekends at a variety of coastal resorts like Blackpool and Bournemouth”, the prospect of “red-hot Lancashire derbies against grand old names like Burnley and Preston North End” and, best of all, the “chance to snuggle up together in the ‘cosy’ stands we’ll be visiting on our away trips”. Among them, Lincoln City, Macclesfield Town and York City. Villa are not quite that broken but, equally, it is difficult finding any reasons for them to be cheerful when Walsall and Burton Albion could conceivably be on their list of derbies next season and the stench of disillusionment, built up over six years of drift, listless performances and boardroom buffoonery, has become so overpowering it is difficult to imagine that fumigating the place will be a quick fix. The financial impact, even taking into account the parachute money from the Premier League, means losing upwards of £200m merely from television revenue if they cannot find a way back during the next three years. The new television deal comes into force in August and will be worth £8.3bn over that time. Then factor in the lost ticket revenue, sponsorship and other forms of income. However it is dressed up, there has never been a worse time for relegation. All of which leaves Villa in a harrowing position, bearing in mind the size and history of the place and the feeling I still get, 25 years after walking down Witton Lane for the first time, that the imposing red-brick walls, the steps leading to the Holte End, the statues of the lions, the colours and the noise make Villa Park one of football’s special monuments. The club have, if nothing else, recognised that it is not just the playing staff that has to be overhauled and begun the process by bringing in Bernstein as well as a new chairman, Steve Hollis, and creating new positions on the board for Brian Little, a former Villa player and manager, and Adrian Bevington, previously of the Football Association. That, at least, is a start and few will miss the former chief executive, Tom Fox, or the sporting director, Hendrik Almstadt, who has also been ushered off the premises. All the same, there is an awful lot of work to be done when, trying to make sense of the Randy Lerner era, there is a jarring irony that they have just lopped off the word “Prepared” from their expensively redesigned club crest (Villa having spent more on that badge and all the necessary changes than Lerner was apparently prepared to pay for any players in January to get them out of this hole). One long-serving employee was asked recently to undertake a quiz on Villa’s history to convince the people above her that she should keep her job. In total, there could be 100 job losses and it will be intriguing to see whether Paddy Riley, the former video analyst who now goes by the title of director of scouting and recruitment, is spared. Riley’s transfer record hardly eases the suspicion that he has been overpromoted and there is an excruciating story about what happened when the agent of one signing turned up to negotiate the contract. Riley had been put in charge along with the club secretary, Sharon Barnhurst, and the agent was so unimpressed by the absence of more senior staff he is said to have taken one look and walked out in a fit of pique. Riley did, in fairness, persuade him to return. Nigel Pearson is an obvious candidate for the manager’s job but there are no indications that Lerner is any closer to finding a buyer and, in the meantime, the bottom line is that Villa have become a tragicomedy, on and off the pitch. One of the club’s European scouts, with responsibility for Spain and Portugal, turns out to be a journalism student. Another is said to have emigrated to Australia earlier this season, at a time when his role was apparently to cover the Bundesliga. As for the players, what does it say for Gabriel Agbonlahor – born in Birmingham, affiliated to Villa since a young age and someone, you might assume, who would give everything for his club – that he is so bereft of professional decency he has just been placed on a two-week fitness programme because he cannot even keep himself in shape? Agbonlahor, with one goal all season, spent the last international break partying in Dubai. His attitude is symptomatic of the culture of drift and, if Villa have serious aspirations of restoring some dignity, this summer might be a good time to thank him for happier days and cut him loose. It is a tremendous mess and, plainly, it is easier for Lerner to avoid awkward questions about his culpability when the other option is to keep his distance, holed away in the Hamptons, and communicate in occasional statements via the club’s website. “I can’t think of anyone else in Cleveland sports in the last 30 years who rode into town with similar fanfare and delivered so little in comparison,” Bill Livingston, the American sportswriter, once wrote of Lerner’s time in charge of the Cleveland Browns, and Villa’s followers will note the similarities. “The biggest constant among those Randy hired was a lack of judgment,” Livingston concluded. “He wasn’t a good owner by any means, but he wasn’t a lucky one, either.” One day, maybe, the subject of all this criticism will be decent enough to answer the principal charge that he simply went cold on Villa, having been unable to break into the Champions League positions in his early years, and withdrew to a point that it became inevitable stagnation would follow. Not the most important thing right now, perhaps, but Lerner could also explain why Fox’s annual salary was almost five times higher than that of the previous chief executive, Paul Faulkner, up from £265,792 to £1,255,769. Maybe he could let us know whether it was really necessary to have 496 members of staff, the sixth highest in the league, compared with, say, Tottenham Hotspur (380), Newcastle United (288) and Everton (274), and more than the combined workforce of West Ham (250) and Leicester (188). And maybe, like Bernstein all those years ago, he might want to apologise to all those supporters who suspected this mismanagement and apathy would take them only one direction. Kevin doesn’t need friends like these The decision to remove Kevin Friend from refereeing duties for Tottenham Hotspur’s visit to Stoke City on Monday was always bewildering but especially now it transpires that he is apparently a Bristol City supporter. Friend lives in Leicester and, by his own admission, has been to watch Claudio Ranieri’s team this season, but taking him off a game because a few daft people think he will deliberately give decisions against Spurs sets a dangerous precedent, as Arsène Wenger has stated, and it all seems particularly unnecessary when the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has made it clear he had no issue whatsoever with the original choice of officials. Friend’s treatment comes across as a lack of trust from the organisation that employs him – even if, conversely, the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd will argue the decision was taken to protect him - and if it is true that it stemmed from a social‑media campaign from Spurs fans (one that certainly passed me by) should the decision-makers really be pandering to the Twitter orchestra? Sure enough, there are now Everton supporters questioning the appointment of Anthony Taylor for their team’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on the basis that he lives in Altrincham, just a few miles from Old Trafford. Already, it has been noted that Michael Oliver – a Newcastle supporter, apparently – refereed Norwich’s 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend and turned down a penalty appeal that might have led to the game being drawn and, in turn, ultimately benefited his own club. Nobody had given it a second thought until now but no doubt there will be fans of other clubs scouring referees’ profiles to come up with historic grievances or flimsy arguments why further restrictions should be placed. A different case could be highlighted every week and the referees are probably entitled to wonder why their organisation has given credence to a fuss about nothing. PFA awards fail to tell whole story The Professional Footballers’ Association holds its player of the year awards next weekend and it would be a surprise, looking back at the last eight months, if the prize went to anyone bar one of the three Leicester City players – Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kanté – on the six‑man shortlist. What, though, if Leicester suddenly implode from this point onwards and Harry Kane’s goals take Tottenham Hotspur to the title? Who would ultimately be the more deserving player? It is certainly strange that the PFA holds this event a month before the season has finished and even more so that the voting slips had an 8 April deadline but actually started coming back at the beginning of March, when some teams still had 10 games to play. In 2016, is it really beyond Gordon Taylor and his colleagues to hold the event at the end of the season and find an online voting system that means the award is for the full campaign?\n",
      "How do you become music's next big thing? You hope your record label will spend, spend, spend Jack Garratt won the BBC Sound of 2016 poll less than a fortnight ago, but behind the scenes, the lobbying by record labels on behalf of the acts they want to win the 2017 poll is already swinging into action. Since the BBC launched the Sound of … poll in 2003, it has become a flagpole event for launching and breaking new acts, a convenient cavalry charge at a time when the album market started to go into freefall. With the record industry keen to turn any lifeline it is handed into a whip with which to direct the market, it didn’t take long for it to become virtually a monopoly, shaped and directed by the incredible marketing weight and promotional expenditure of a handful of labels. From its earliest days, Sound of … has been criticised as a cordoned-off VIP room for the major labels. Indeed, only one act on an independent label has ever won it – Adele in 2008, when signed to XL Recordings. EMI, when it still existed and before it was carved up between Universal and Warner, managed to win once in 2006 with Corinne Bailey Rae. Warner also managed to win once in 2009 with Little Boots. Sony has never had an act win. Acts signed to Universal and its imprints, however, have won it 11 times in the past 14 years. Universal’s signings have triumphed every single year since 2010. Rather than it being a syndicate for the majors, it’s increasingly looking like a cartel for Universal – the biggest and most profitable record label in the world – and its sub-labels. There is no suggestion that there’s anything corrupt going on; simply that the results of the poll reflect the fact that those with the biggest marketing budgets can make their acts much more visible, and therefore much more likely to win. But the result has been that the BBC’s poll is less a promoter of talent than a promoter of commerce. “It is presented as a certainty,” says one independent publicist, speaking anonymously, who long ago stopped putting forward acts for consideration. “I find the whole thing monumentally fucking depressing.” Another independent publicist, speaking off the record, remembers feeling that a few leftfield acts were starting to make the longlist at the turn of the decade, which inspired them to consider pushing one of their acts for the Sound of 2011 poll. “As soon as I started to pitch to people, I realised the decisions had already started to be made,” they say. Why are publicists so important to the process? Because journalists make up the majority of the 144 voters. Although the panel includes a selection of the BBC’s most respected new music presenters and producers, the majority of the pundits are from newspapers, magazines, blogs and commercial radio and TV. “We hope to represent a huge spectrum of music from across the world, covering a diverse range of musical styles and backgrounds,” the BBC’s website says. “When selecting the pundits, the BBC is looking for the most genuine and passionate music fans, whose day-job also involves showcasing the best new music to a wider audience. None of them work full-time for record labels, management or PR, and none of them can make money directly from the success of the artists. None of the pundits are paid for taking part.” No one makes money, no one is paid. And the pundits do not, as the BBC takes care to stress, vote from a list of predetermined acts. But most of the voters are besieged by new music all year round: it’s only natural, if unfortunate, that the acts they remember, come voting time, are the ones who have been thrust upon them with the greatest frequency. Simply, these are the names that get remembered. “I would imagine that the vast majority of people who are voting are not the people who will spend ages on Bandcamp buying music and investigating what else is being recommended around those artists,” says one writer who still votes each year, even if they know they are throwing a sponge at a tornado. “There were a few years where I thought: ‘Fuck this – I don’t want to do it.’ I hated the way it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.” At the turn of this decade, the PR machines began roaring to life around six months before voting took place, to get the preferred names into the right minds. Today, it is a year in advance. Having a publicist devote this much time to pushing forward an anointed act is not cheap. Which prices out the small acts who would gain the most from an award that is meant to reward musical promise rather than – as with the Brits critics’ choice award (also won this year by Garratt) – highlight the act most likely to be successful over the following year. “If someone wanted my undivided time to launch a new act over the course of a year, it would cost about 10 grand,” says the head of one small independent PR firm. “If you were talking to one of the big PR firms, they’d probably charge two grand a month. Major labels are the only ones who have the money to bankroll something like that.” Add in similar costs for a TV and radio plugger, to get the music aired in public and make voters feel that said act really is the kind of label priority worth voting for, and the same again for an online marketing team to make things appear “viral” and “organic”, and you will be lucky to get much change out of £100,000. Labels say that the cost of developing and launching a new mainstream pop act today can be anywhere between £500,000 and £1m. With winning the tastemaker polls seen as the blue chip moment in a launch campaign, it’s clear why an increasing number of chips from a decreasing number of bettors are being stacked on the side of the BBC’s roulette wheel. It’s not that the BBC decided to create a poll that required this level of expenditure, but that the major labels have, in effect, turned it into one. “With Jack Garratt, there was a lot of excitement around him at the Great Escape festival in Brighton last May,” explains a publicist about when it became obvious who was being positioned as the frontrunner for January’s big reveal. “The way they build things is to release a track or a video to create a buzz, and then get the artist to play the showcase festivals. Then, after the Sound … poll, the story is launched into the public consciousness that he is this humble, nice guy who started out busking.” For a label to see anything back from the PR cost of pushing an act, the act would need to both win the poll (mainstream media outlets are not concerned with offering much coverage to the runners-up) and then sell an extra 100,000 albums. Given that most new acts today struggle to reach anything approaching those sales figures, the stakes are far too high for most to even dare compete. Bear in mind, too, that for many indie labels, the significantly lower costs of mounting a campaign for even the Mercury prize are still too high. But the more of them that duck out of the race, the more the poll is at risk of becoming little more than a satellite marketing division of Universal. How can this be resolved? Maybe the solution lies in taking a Logan’s Run approach to the voting process, whereby anyone over the age of 30 is automatically retired from the panel, and voting rights are handed back to those most enthusiastic about the music and least concerned with backing a winner. As it stands, the poll is more of a coronation than a competition. Despite being given a week to comment for this piece, the BBC has put no one forward. Perhaps there is a realisation there, too, that Sound of … might just as well be renamed Spend of ….\n",
      "Fantastic Negrito: the drug-dealing hustler who became Bernie Sanders' favourite bluesman “You wanna hear my robbery tactics?” says the rangy 48-year-old sitting opposite me in a Soho ramen house. “I’d make friends with the kid that was not that popular. I’d go to his house. I’d find a house key and secretly make a copy. Then I’d find out the schedule of the family. Then, when they were gone, I’d make my move. I was that kind of robber.” Ask Xavier Dphrepaulezz (it’s pronounced “dee-FREP-ah-lez”) about any of his past lives – including his teenage years of petty crime while in foster care – and he has a way of taking you to the heart of the action. His story is, by any criteria, extraordinary, and the enjoyment he derives from sharing it is infectious. The singer, who describes himself as a lifelong hustler, landed in London this morning for the first time in a decade. Last time he was here, long before his current incarnation as Fantastic Negrito, he was briefly the blue-haired frontman of Blood Sugar X, a manic Cali-funk-punk collective “in the tradition of bands like Bad Brains and Fishbone”. Ten years earlier, he was simply Xavier, peddling innocuous MTV funk before a car crash put him in a coma for three weeks and laid his pop star aspirations to waste. Far from distancing himself from all these personas, Dphrepaulezz places his phone on the table and Googles them for you, lest you imagine he has anything to hide. After half a lifetime spent chasing a break, Dphrepaulezz’s luck turned when he stopped trying. To start with, there was the DIY video for his song Lost in a Crowd, which last year saw off more than 7,000 allcomers to win the National Public Radio (NPR) Tiny Desk competition. He was railroaded into submitting the song by the other members of Blackball Universe, the Californian arts cooperative he co-founded to create a structure of mutual support among struggling black artists. Dphrepaulezz’s prize was the chance to follow in the footsteps of Adele and Florence and the Machine – and record a concert for NPR. One person who connected with Dphrepaulezz’s urgent blues epistles was Bernie Sanders. It’s easy to see why a man running for the Democratic presidential nomination on a leftwing ticket might seize on, say, a song called Working Poor. When Sanders heard it, he enlisted Dphrepaulezz to play at events around the primaries in New Hampshire and Nevada. On the day we meet, the singer will be beamed across the US, thanks to a performance in Fox’s music industry drama Empire. That’s Fantastic Negrito you can also hear on Ron Perlman’s Amazon series Hand of God: the show’s theme song is the battle-weary testifying of An Honest Man. Dphrepaulezz seems as much a bemused onlooker as a participant in the events of his life. The first time he heard any of the blues records that inform Fantastic Negrito’s debut album, The Last Days of Oakland, their concerns seemed a world away from his own. Aged eight, Dphrepaulezz was visiting relatives in south Virginia. The music playing in their house bore as little relevance to his life as the classical-pop records favoured by his father – a half-Somalian, half-Caribbean restaurateur born in 1905. Until the age of 12, home for Dphrepaulezz and his 14 siblings was rural Massachusetts. “My dad was a strict Muslim. He had a lot of rules,” he recalls. You probably have to be strict, I suggest, if you’re raising 15 kids. “Well,” he shoots back, “he wasn’t strict when he was making them.” When the family moved to California in 1979, setting up home across the bay from San Francisco in Oakland, they were in effect releasing him into the wild. Gang-controlled drug-dealing had brought the city to the brink of lawlessness. Confronted by “this explosion of counterculture” – hip-hop, thrash metal and punk all meeting in one location – Dphrepaulezz made new friends, left home and didn’t come back. “We were all selling drugs, man. We all carried pistols. There was a crack epidemic. Mostly, I was small-time. I was the kind of kid who would sell fake weed, shit like that. Sometimes I would use tea. What was it that the Beatles would smoke from a pipe in order to try and get high? Typhoid?” Typhoo tea? “That’s the shit!” Dphrepaulezz’s saving grace was that, even as a teenage drug-dealer, he avoided ingesting anything heavier than weed. This period, spent pinballing between foster families, seems to have hardened his political outlook. “As long as we have have predatory capitalism,” he says, “we’ll have guns, because the gun industry loves to make money out of guns. They don’t care if children die. What concerns them is profit.” Dphrepaulezz rarely gets emotional when going over these distant memories. But the death of Prince is another matter. “His Dirty Mind album changed everything for me,” he says, momentarily faltering. “Someone told me he was self-taught and that opened the door for me. I was 18 and getting into trouble. I was thinking, ‘What can I do that’s safe?’ So I started teaching myself how to play.” His method was nothing if not ingenious. He “grew long sideburns” and pretended to be a student at the University of Berkeley. Taking the 40-minute bus ride north every day, he would head for its music rooms, copying students as they practised their scales. By day, he was not quite a student; by night, he was not quite a gangster. The realisation that he was “small-time” came when he and his friends bought some firearms from a gang, who returned to their house, held Dphrepaulezz at knifepoint and took the rest of their money. “The next day I got out. I hitchhiked to LA with $100 and a keyboard.” There, Dphrepaulezz was surprised to find that a decade of hustling had been the perfect music business apprenticeship. A deal with Prince’s former manager was followed in 1993 by a $1m deal with Interscope, which he almost instantly regretted. Released in 1996, Xavier’s passable debut album The X-Factor pleased neither himself nor his hit-hungry paymasters. Three years of limbo ensued, which were broken one Thanksgiving evening. Dphrepaulezz’s car was hit by a drunk driver who ran a red light. “I fishtailed and rolled over four lanes of traffic.” The first thing he remembers after waking up three weeks later was the sensation of having a beard – not that he could lift his arms to feel it. The accident had broken both his arms and his legs, leaving his strumming hand mangled. Far from sending him into freefall, Dphrepaulezz says the crash “released” him. Interscope terminated his contract and Dphrepaulezz reverted to the only other thing he knew: the hustle. Noticing that the only nightclubbing opportunities in LA involved “$20 for parking, $20 to get in, and at least $20 when you’re in, I converted the warehouse where I lived in South Central into an illegal nightclub. I knocked down a few walls and built a bar that looked kind of like a pimps-from-outer-space thing. Velvet movie theatre seats. A hot tub on the roof. Nude body painting.” When Club Bingo wasn’t paying host to a clientele that included Alicia Silverstone, Mike Tyson and Eric Benét, its creator was working under a bewildering array of alter egos – among them Chocolate Butterfly, Me and This Japanese Guy and the aforementioned Blood Sugar X – and licensing material to film and TV shows. When he and his Japanese partner had a son, he stopped looking for further incarnations, sold all of his equipment except for one guitar, moved back to Oakland and bought himself a smallholding with no greater plan than to supplement his publishing royalties by growing “medical marijuana” and eating homegrown corn, tomatoes and freshly laid eggs. Five years had elapsed since he last played his guitar. His fingers were still crooked from the accident, but he had just enough mobility to play a G chord for his son in an attempt to stop him from crying. “His entire face changed,” recalls the proud father. He learned the Beatles’ Across the Universe and played it to him every night for a year. With that came a slew of new songs, informed this time by the blues records that had bewildered him on that childhood vacation in Virginia. “In the middle of the conflict between me myself and lies / I saw people die for nothing / I sold coke to hungry eyes,” went his first song, Night Turned to Day. Together with Malcolm Spellman, his longtime Oakland friend who would go on to write Empire, Dphrepaulezz threw his publishing royalties into the Oakland art gallery, label and creative space that became their Blackball Universe cooperative. Within strolling distance is the Blues Walk of Fame, which commemorates musicians who passed through the city in its pre-gentrification days. “Black roots music is part of our story here,” says Dphrepaulezz. “Our art comes from their struggle. You think of that and you stay humble.” But to really understand why Dphrepaulezz is now succeeding, you have to see him in action. A few days later, at London’s Rough Trade East, near the end of an electrifying performance, he plays Lost in the Crowd. As his clawed hand plays the last chord, he loosens his neck tie, leans into the mic and revisits its inception. “My collective calls me a narcissist,” he tells the crowd. “They were like, ‘Will you stop writing about yourself? Go look at people! Look around! Aren’t people interesting to you?’ So they sent me off to Berkeley, San Francisco, and told me to watch people for a day. Just sit and watch. So that’s what I did. And that’s what this song is.” It’s surely no surprise that Dphrepaulezz sees his own values reflected in those of Sanders. It was the collective power of a wider group that launched Fantastic Negrito on to the world, while the “predatory capitalism” against which he rails almost claimed him before he reached adulthood. Back at the ramen house, he tries one more time to make sense of the past few years. “I thought my story was over. But that was when I realised I finally had a story to tell – and it seems to remind people of their own story.” • The Last Days of Oakland is out now on Blackball Universe\n"

      "Manchester City pin hopes on key trio after West Ham expose flaws While José Mourinho picked the wrong moment to talk about fake results when Manchester City thumped Chelsea 3-0 in August, the recently unemployed one certainly made a valid point about how the final score can unfairly alter the narrative. Mourinho’s line came to mind after more ruthless finishing from Sergio Agüero rescued a barely deserved point for Manuel Pellegrini’s stuttering title challengers at Upton Park, leaving West Ham United with the rare sensation of feeling disappointed after failing to secure their first league double over City in 53 years. West Ham led twice, only for Agüero to cancel out Enner Valencia’s snappy double with two goals of his own, and there is a temptation to praise City for mounting spirited fightbacks from a goal down in both halves. Scoring an 81st minute equaliser at the home of a team who relish bloodying the noses of opponents with superior resources is usually interpreted as a sign of belief, resolve and togetherness. Scratch the surface, however, and City’s wide range of flaws soon begin to emerge. They were evident as early as the first minute, when Cheikhou Kouyaté tore past a half-hearted challenge from Yaya Touré in the build-up to West Ham’s opener, and they materialised again in the 56th minute, amateurish defending allowing Valencia to score his second after the striker muscled on to a huge throw from Michail Antonio. The beaten Joe Hart made no attempt to hide his displeasure with his defence. City badly miss the assurance of their captain, Vincent Kompany, and Pellegrini was unable to say when the Belgian centre-back will return from his latest calf injury. Nicolas Otamendi was embarrassed by Valencia for the second goal and Martín Demichelis was fortunate not to be sent off for a cynical challenge on Antonio in the first half. Playing alongside Fabian Delph, Touré’s failings were exposed by West Ham, who are sixth after a run of one defeat in 10 matches. Alex Song was dominant in midfield and Dimitri Payet’s skill took the breath away. Pellegrini’s defence of Touré was as convincing as Otamendi’s attempt to stop Valencia. “He played today as a defensive midfielder,” Pellegrini said. “I think that Yaya played in that position without any problem.” That was a generous assessment. Yet the defensive deficiencies do not tell the full story. In the league, City have not had consecutive victories since October and have won one of their past eight away games. For all Agüero’s opportunism, they drifted after going 2-1 down. David Silva faded after a promising start, Kevin de Bruyne could not shake off Sam Byram and Jesús Navas was shackled by Aaron Cresswell. Raheem Sterling’s impact as a substitute was minimal. At least Kelechi Iheanacho was bright after replacing Delph, his driving run leading to Agüero nonchalantly making it 2-2. “They put us under pressure,” Slaven Bilic said. “We were under pressure but the good point is, let’s say second half, when we beat them at the Etihad 2-1, second half, it was the Alamo, it was like them, them, them. We were kicking the ball out. This was like, with our quality, we were also keeping the ball, we were stretching them.” Yet, although City lacked hunger and purpose, they remain three points off the top. They are playing within themselves and they may only require a slight improvement to win the league, especially if Agüero stays fit. The best striker in England has started 2016 with six goals in six matches. “The last problem was when he was with his national squad” Pellegrini said. “He scored four times against Newcastle and I changed him as he was feeling some problems. Unfortunately he played for his national squad three or four days after and he had a muscle injury. So I hope now that he is 100% fit and he does not have any problem and it is very important that the team plays with him in every game. “In the first 23 games, in the 11 players who played the most minutes, we don’t have Agüero, Silva, Kompany. I hope that in the second part of the season they will be involved in all the games because they are very important.” Man of the match Alex Song (West Ham United)\n",
      "Fans dismay as Premier League snubs cap on away ticket prices The Football Supporters’ Federation has expressed bitter disappointment that Premier League clubs failed to back a measure to cap away ticket prices at their most recent meeting, while Liverpool have expressed dismay at the news that some of their supporters are to stage a walkout from Saturday’s game against Sunderland in protest at the new Anfield pricing structure. It is understood that while no vote was taken on away tickets at Thursday’s meeting of all the Premier League clubs, informal soundings were taken that made it clear the proposal would not received the two-thirds majority required. Discussions are continuing about whether clubs, promised an £8.3bn bounty from broadcasting rights, will agree to an across-the-board cap on away prices or seek instead to boost the existing away fans ticket fund. The FSF chief executive, Kevin Miles, who has been leading its Twenty’s Plenty campaign for a £20 cap, said: “We are incredibly disappointed to learn that a proposed cap on away ticket prices was voted down by the Premier League clubs yesterday in a secret ballot. Supporters will not let them off the hook. “Football supporters are right to be angry about the Premier League clubs’ apparent reluctance to tackle the problem of ticket prices. Top-flight clubs have known since last year that they will be receiving a huge increase in their TV revenues. In the light of that windfall, Premier League clubs cannot justify maintaining high ticket prices, particularly for away fans.” He added: “Despite clubs failing to agree a way forward yesterday, this issue will not go away and fans will continue to fight for fair ticket prices. We understand that the Premier League will be working with clubs over the coming weeks to find a way forward. That must result in meaningful action on away prices at the next shareholders’ meeting at the end of March. If clubs have the will to do this there must be a way.” Arsenal fans this week complained that the club was asking season ticket holders for a surcharge of up to £30 for their home Champions League tie against Barcelona, although the club released a statement on Friday night which said they would cancel the charge given the outcry. It is understood that most clubs largely agree on the need for action on away ticket prices, having accepted that they are crucial to providing the atmosphere that helps maintain the Premier League’s broadcasting income. But some clubs are believed to be reluctant to agree a universal cap for fear that it will erode their ability to set their own prices or could lead to complaints from home fans who sit in equivalent seats but pay more. Instead, they favour an increase to the away fans fund, which currently stands at £200,000 per club per season and can be spent however each individual club sees fit. The FSF would like to see both a cap and an increase to the fund, as well as a commitment to continue to engage on wider ticket pricing issues. The matter will now be discussed again at the next meeting of Premier League clubs in late March, which will be their last before next season’s prices are set. Arsenal denied that they were among the clubs against movement on ticket prices, but are understood to favour an increase in the fund rather than a price cap. “We argued for the most extensive package of support for travelling fans and we are sure there will be a good solution,” said a spokesman.\n",
      "Jermain Defoe hat-trick sees Sunderland sink 10-man Swansea When the dust settles on this extraordinary match – and that could take a while – the referee will cease to become the main talking point for Swansea City and the threat of relegation will start to bite. Graham Scott, who was asked to take charge of the game at short notice after Andre Marriner pulled out on Monday, looked totally out of his depth at this level, yet the erroneous decisions that impacted on both teams were of little concern to Sunderland come the end. Inspired by the evergreen Jermain Defoe, who completed his hat-trick five minutes from time and took his tally to five in two games in the process, Sunderland picked up the most precious of victories to move within one point of Swansea and give their survival hopes a huge boost. It was a crazy, helter-skelter game and one that was overshadowed by some calamitous refereeing from a man who was officiating only his fourth Premier League game. Defoe looked to be offside when he gave Sunderland a third-minute lead and it should not have been a penalty when Wes Brown was penalised for fouling André Ayew later in the first half. Then came arguably the defining moment in the match when Scott sent off Kyle Naughton in the 37th minute for a challenge on Yann M’Vila that was not worthy of a free-kick never mind a straight red card. The full-back’s studs were high but he clearly got the ball and only M’Vila knows why he was rolling around. Although that harsh decision initially galvanised Swansea, who went 2-1 ahead through a superb Ayew goal shortly before the interval, Sunderland’s numerical advantage eventually told. Patrick van Aanholt, who was excellent on the left flank, hauled Sunderland level with a deflected shot and from that point on it was all about Defoe. Alan Curtis, Swansea’s interim manager, was bitterly upset and felt Scott’s decision to send off Naughton was the turning point. “I’m disappointed. I think the big talking point is the referee’s decisions,” Curtis said. “I won’t say it has cost us as you don’t know how it will play out but it has had a major bearing on the game. Unfortunately the referee did look out of his depth. “We were fortuitous with the penalty decision for us. But when he makes a huge decision to send a player off we were forced to play the next hour with 10. You only have to look at the video and Kyle won the ball cleanly. It is something we will try to appeal in the morning.” Allardyce had some sympathy for Swansea and Naughton on that occasion – he looked across at Curtis and appeared bemused as well as amused when Scott showed a red card – but he also made the point Sunderland were on the wrong end of a bad call with the Ayew penalty incident. “Scott only stepped in because the referee who was supposed to referee the game was ill,” the Sunderland manager said. “In his defence before the game Scott pointed out: ‘I know how big this game is for both of you and I’ll try and manage it the best way I can.’ But things happen under pressure and when people are under pressure they make mistakes.” The referee was not the only one who blundered. Lukasz Fabianski’s terrible goalkick led to Sunderland’s opener when he drilled the ball straight to Adam Johnson, who fed Fabio Borini on the left. Borini’s low shot was parried by Fabianski and Defoe, who had strayed into an offside position, tapped home. Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the spot after Scott deemed Brown had tripped Ayew when the Ghanaian had actually stubbed his foot into the ground. Three minutes after Naughton’s dismissal Swansea were in front when Ayew, sprinting on to Fabianski’s measured kick, beat Lee Cattermole and struck home a sumptuous left-foot angled drive that flashed into the far corner. With an extra man, Allardyce urged his players to press higher up the pitch in the second half and Sunderland quickly got reward when Van Aanholt cut inside and thumped an 18-yard shot that took a wicked deflection off Federico Fernández’s back and went in off the far upright. Defoe, running on to Johnson’s fine pass, then beat Fabianski to grab his second – again the striker appeared offside – before later turning in Van Aanholt’s cut-back for his third. “Jermain’s a massive player for us and converted most of the chances we created,” Allardyce said. “And irrespective of some of the referee’s decisions we’ve gone and won away in an enormous game for both of us because we’ve gained three points on everybody that is above.”\n",
      "Tottenham steamroller lacklustre Stoke with Son Heung-min double Mark Hughes told Tottenham Hotspur fans to shut up, but his team could not silence the visiting forwards. Son Heung-min scored twice before Dele Alli and Harry Kane struck their first goals of the campaign and, in doing so, confirmed that Tottenham are up and running for the new season after playing fitfully in their first three matches. Hughes, meanwhile, may have disciplinary matters to fret about in addition to his team’s botched start to the season after being sent to the stands in the first half. Stoke are bottom of the league with one point from four matches. Tottenham took the lead thanks to their ability to keep calm in the storm caused in part by Stoke’s fury with the referee, Anthony Taylor, and the fourth official, Jon Moss. Taylor, acting on advice from Moss, ordered Hughes to vacate the sideline in the 34th minute after the manager stomped out of his technical area to vent his anger at the booking of Marko Arnautovic for simulation. Hughes felt that Stoke should have been given a free-kick before that for a foul on Jonathan Walters and was doubly aggrieved when Taylor judged Arnautovic’s “evasive action” to be a dive. “Those were two decisions I felt should have gone our way so I reacted in a forceful manner,” Hughes said. “Sometimes you forget that this year you’re not allowed to come out of your technical area. Mr Moss, bless him, felt that warranted a sending off, which, by the letter of the law, it did, so I have to hold my hands up. But I saw Sky say that maybe I swore, which I didn’t.” As he left the pitch Hughes made gestures to rev up the home crowd. Then he tried to send a different message to away supporters. “I was telling them to shut up,” he said. “Sorry if I did that.” That hoopla created a sizzling atmosphere in which players needed to stay cool. Spurs did so better and were rewarded by Son’s goal in the 41st minute. Joe Allen might have thwarted it if he had not overcommitted when trying to dispossess Christian Eriksen, allowing the Dane to sidestep him before pulling the ball back from the sideline to Son, who was unmarked 12 yards from goal. The South Korean guided it first time into the net with his left foot. Such composure in the bedlam can only have encouraged Mauricio Pochettino, bearing in mind how his team lost their heads and the league title at Stamford Bridge last season. Earlier, Spurs had to show resilience to weather a storm of another kind, as Stoke started strongly. Wilfried Bony, making his debut for the hosts after joining on loan from Manchester City, gave the team a much-needed fulcrum up front. The Ivorian threatened as early as the second minute when he exchanged passes with Walters before unleashing a 16-yard shot that was blocked by Jan Vertonghen. Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross also had efforts foiled by defenders. Tottenham gradually took the upperhand, however, thanks to the crispness and swiftness of their passing. Son served notice of his menace by collecting a crossfield pass from Toby Alderweireld on the half-hour and dashing towards the Stoke area. Arnautovic chased back to disrupt his progress but inadvertently played the ball into the path of Alli. He dragged a shot past the advancing Shay Given but wide of the post. Then, following Hughes’s expulsion, Son shot Spurs in front. Half-time brought a chance to regroup and Stoke did hint at a comeback early in the second half. But Son quashed it with a superb strike on the counterattack, collecting another pass from Eriksen at the corner of the area and sweeping a first-time shot in at the far post. Stoke began to unravel. “The second goal deflated us more markedly than it should have,” Hughes said. Spurs were not minded to show mercy. The visitors inflicted further damage through another rapid counterattack on the hour. Kyle Walker hurtled down the right and picked out Alli, who, like Son for the first goal, had found space in the middle of the area and took full advantage. With Victor Wanyama on a yellow card and guilty of a couple of tackles that the home crowd believed should have resulted in a red, Pochettino made a substitution to ensure Tottenham kept 11 players on the pitch, replacing Wanyama with Érik Lamela. “It was better to take the pressure off the referee and Victor,” said Pochettino. All that was missing from Spurs’ point of view was a goal for Harry Kane. So Son helped deliver one. He tricked his way down the left before providing a pass that enabled Kane to end the wait for his first goal of the campaign.\n",
      "Premier League 2016-17 preview: 11 things to look out for this season 1. Manchester manager wars So here it is – the long-awaited new series of Pep versus José. Neutrals are hoping for a classic rerun of the meltdowns that made the Barcelona/Real Madrid years so special – but early signs are that both managers are making an effort to coexist. Last month Guardiola denied he’d spend the season refusing to shake Mourinho’s hand (“We are polite guys, why not shake, why not shake? No reason”), and José says he’s completely over it. “Individual fights make no sense in England. If I focus on him and he on me, someone else is going to win the league.” They meet for the first time at Old Trafford on 10 September. Time will tell. 2. Arsène Wenger’s farewell tour? Away from that excitement, everything feels pretty familiar at the Emirates. On 1 October it will be 20 years since Arsène Wenger took over: 20 years since he told the sceptics: “I am like every human - I have my weaknesses. I would say to you I try every day to be better than the day before, but I am conscious that I have to win over the supporters. They don’t know me.” Two decades later, they do know him, but the “winning over” process is still ongoing. Signs are this will be Wenger’s last at the club. Could it end in glory? 3. Zlatan’s impact Having trailed his Old Trafford move with a Hollywood hashtag – “#iamcoming” – self-billed “king” and “legend” Zlatan Ibrahimovic needs to deliver early on. But, generously, he says he’s prepared to share the headlines with colleagues, including Wayne Rooney. “Every big player can work with other big players. That’s not a problem. I see no problems here. Just success.” 4. Leicester’s tricky encore How do you follow a fairytale? Do it all over again, or slip into graceful decline? N’Golo Kanté is gone, and pre-season has been testing – a 4-0 defeat to PSG and 4-2 to Barcelona – but key title-winners remain, including Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Danny Drinkwater and captain Wes Morgan. Last season Claudio Ranieri said Morgan was “Baloo off the Jungle Book. He is a big gentle bear. He does not speak so much but when he does speak, everybody listens. He is the perfect captain.” 5. The reinvention of David Moyes It’s been a tough few years. Humiliated at United, Moyes achieved meme status when this photo of him meeting fans at Old Trafford went viral – captioned online: “I have no idea what is happening”. Then came 12 grim months at Real Sociedad. But now he’s back, at a club much more like Everton. “In my first season at Everton, after the club had continually avoided relegation, I think we finished seventh,” he said. “Will that happen with Sunderland? It will be very difficult, but I have to believe there’s a possibility.” Expect heavy last-minute spending: Christian Benteke has been linked. 6. New-look homes We’re all invested in West Ham’s new ground, literally. The £701m stadium, with the club chipping in £15m, opened last week, and is a world away from Green Street. The rebrand is neat – but no amount of green sheeting is going to disguise that 30m gap between the stand and the pitch. Elsewhere, Liverpool will unveil their new £114m Main Stand. They paid for it themselves. 7. Hull’s new manager… … is already, before being appointed, being tipped as this season’s sack race winner. Hull’s pre-season bid for crisis-club status has been slick: Steve Bruce walking away, Mohamed Diamé sold down a division to Newcastle, no signings and Assem Allam still in charge. So expect to see a rare sight on the opening day: fans of a newly-promoted club protesting against their board. Hull face champions Leicester in Saturday’s television curtain-raiser (12.30pm on Sky). 8. A new corporate visual identity Always a thrilling moment: a corporate brand identity refresh – the Premier League’s old Barclays logo gone, and, in its place, a new range of expensive fluorescent sponsor-free logos, which attracted online mockery when they were unveiled in February. League officials called the new branding “a bold and vibrant identity that includes a modern take on the lion icon”; everyone else saw it as primary school-style tribute to Aslan. Elsewhere, other badge tweaks this season include Manchester City’s new heritage-led logo, and West Ham removing the Boleyn Castle from their badge and adding the word “London”, to help sell the global brand. 9. Which way are Stoke headed? Will Stoke finish ninth for a fourth consecutive season? Or is something less comfortable in store? Mark Hughes – who starts the campaign with a neat new Jeremy Corbyn beard – has some serious momentum-correcting work to do after last season’s run-in – as does Alan Pardew at Palace, who oversaw two wins in 21 league games before dancing his way to FA Cup final defeat. And, also looking unpredictable among the usual mid-table candidates: the newly wealthy Everton. Ronald Koeman has found his kitty hard to spend so far, but he’s trying. “We are working hard to bring in players. I expect better quality on the ball.” 10. Geometric fuse-welding Back with the marketing department, here’s Nike describing this season’s new official ball, the Ordem 4 – featuring a “new wrapped bladder system delivering optimal touch; geometric 12 panel fuse-welded construction employing a new 3D printed ink technique; plus the design principle of ‘Flow Motion’ applying luminance.” In other words, it’s round and colourful. The Premier League ball is blue, green and purple, La Liga’s is navy, orange and yellow, Serie A’s is orange, pink and purple. Collect all three for £285. 11. New rules 95 law changes were announced in May, so expect a long season of indignant mixed-up punditry. Apart from backwards kick-offs, other changes include no more automatic reds for players who accidentally deny a scoring opportunity and an end to forcing injured players to leave the field after quick treatment. But likely to have the biggest impact are changes around dissent. This season it’s an automatic yellow for “showing visible disrespect to officials”; for “running towards an official to contest a decision”; for making any physical contact with officials; and it’s a yellow “for at least one player when two or more surround a match official”. Players who add aggression or abuse to any of the above will upgrade to an automatic red. Stand by for mass suspensions.\n",
      "The end of the night – in the 80s, the Wag Club was glorious but it could never happen now As the march of gentrification and greed transforms London – as well as many of the UK’s other inner cities – one great British institution that has fallen foul has been the nightlife business. In London, the area that has suffered the most is Soho. Once a naughty, massively inspiring little Petri dish from which the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud emerged, it is being rapidly reshaped into something resembling a homogenised shopping mall. One of the first institutions to fall foul of the evisceration of Soho was the Wag, the club Ollie O’Donnell and I founded in 1982 and which ran until 2001. When we began, Soho was really rather seedy and rundown, which was exactly what attracted the young, the groovy and the inventive. The Wag – a nightclub that catered, in the main, to a gang of non-conformist mavericks – was thoroughly appropriate to that crowd. Ollie and I started by packing out the Whisky a Go Go in Wardour Street every Saturday night with our own crowd, then the club’s new leaseholders asked us to run it with them full time. So we lowered the drinks and the door price (which was possible because rents were fair back then), pulled in DJs who played underground music, and the place took off. We were young and aware, so we knew what was happening and approached the running of the club with a zeal that at times dropped us in the proverbial. In November 1982, we hosted the first ever hip-hop club event in the UK, The Roxy Road Show – featuring 25 artists who flew in from New York, including Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore (who invented scratching), Jazzy Jay and Fab 5 Freddy, rope skipping stars the Double Dutch Girls and legendary breakdancers the Rock Steady Crew. It was complete and utter mayhem, but in a good way. The club was absolutely packed when, at my behest, then unknown graffiti artist Futura 2000 did his live spray-can art on stage and more or less asphyxiated everyone. We later made a name for ourselves by booking all the major rap acts – De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Eric B and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E Fresh. It’s been said that we were responsible for breaking hip-hop in the UK but, for me, it made sense in every way: the acts had never played London before, and it was relatively cheap to bring them over. All it took was two or three discounted flights and a couple of nights in a friend’s dad’s hotel in Bloomsbury. Simple economics. Because I’d been in a band it was my job to source, book and promote the live acts. Sometimes they worked and other times they did not. Even though we all knew of Shane MacGowan’s proclivities I booked Pogue Mahone just as they were starting off. The third time they played, MacGowan was so drunk I was surprised he could stand, never mind sing, but it made no difference because the show stopped after 20 minutes when he tried to hit bassist Cait O’Riordan over the head with his guitar. Then there was the legendary jazz maestro Slim Gaillard, who sold out the club but, rather in his cups, retired to the bar after two songs, fell asleep on it and woke up two hours later, his backing band and the crowd having long departed. I turned down a Prince afterparty/jam session because I’d already booked Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry on the same night. He cost us a packet, but the club was crammed so all was OK until Perry, somewhat chemically enhanced, sang the same song (his new single) 15 times and emptied the club before midnight. We lost our shirts. But there were bigger losses – Bobby Womack’s show was cancelled an hour before it was due to start because of a bomb scare round the corner in Leicester Square; Gil Scott Heron’s gig was called off when he was arrested at Heathrow for possession of cocaine. Both had sold out and we had to refund all ticket holders, leaving us with the cost of the flights and hotel rooms. Of course, other acts were simply magnificent. I recall the surprise on Georgie Fame’s face as he looked out at the crowd of immaculate mods, dressed just as they would have when he played the Flamingo (in the basement of the Whisky a Go Go) in 1962. James Brown’s backing band the JBs were gobsmacked that the crowd (many in 70s kit) knew all their numbers by heart. New acts thrived, too: Sade, Fine Young Cannibals, Curiosity Killed the Cat, the Pasadenas and Swing Out Sister were all signed after shows at the Wag. The Wag was synonymous with what was happening on the street. We played a huge role in kick-starting the acid house movement by hosting sets from Marshall Jefferson, Tony Humphries, Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry and Masters at Work, among many others, while Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong and Andy Weatherall established their reps at the Wag. But it wasn’t just about music. It was also about meeting people and showing off. Diehard regular Jonathan Ross met his wife Jane Goldman at the Wag. Designers such as John Galliano paraded their designs here; Leigh Bowery strutted his magnificent stuff; future Turner prize winners Tracey Emin and Grayson Perry were regulars; Boy George, Joe Strummer and Neneh Cherry came every week for a little dance. All the attention meant global superstars came to our little ramshackle venue (with no VIP area) for a look: David Bowie (who came a lot and filmed his Blue Jean video there), Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Prince, George Clinton, Stevie Wonder, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier. George Michael had a fight with our DJ Fat Tony and Grace Jones had to be physically restrained after laying out an irritating bloke with a single punch. Some have said that at one point the Wag was the grooviest club on the planet, but I couldn’t tell. I was too busy trying to fill a Tuesday night. None had this would have happened had we not been in our mid-20s, not that different from most of our patrons, and brave (or stupid) enough to take chances and, most importantly, had the rent not been cheap enough for us to experiment. Today, not only would I not be able to run a West End club, I wouldn’t even be able to hang out in Soho, because landlords and developers have priced the young and not-so-well-off out of inner London. It has been suggested that London should follow Amsterdam, Paris, Zurich and Toulouse and appoint a night mayor to protect our after-dark businesses and the people who use them. Certainly, unless something is done we will lose the talent that has traditionally risen through our night-time economy – graphic designers, artists, DJs, entertainers writers, photographers and musicians of every kind who hone their skills and develop by working with clubs and promoters. I don’t think its possible to overestimate just how important this is for any city or country, and that is why Amsterdam, Paris and Zurich are protecting their nightlife. We have to follow suit before it’s too late. Chris Sullivan presents The Wag Club is available now on Harmless Records.\n",
      "Liverpool 2-2 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened That’s all for now! Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back later for a full match report from Anfield. Here’s a game where the substitutions changed everything. Liverpool let their foot off the glass briefly and it came back to bite them. Not that Newcastle will turn down the gifted point, which they desperately need in their relegation battle. 90 min+3: One last chance for Liverpool as Lovren moves quickly up the middle of the pitch and plays it forward. It goes out for an apparent corner but before it can be awarded, the referee blows the whistle for full time. 90 min: Entering the final stages Newcastle seem on track for the most improbable of points. Three minutes of stoppage time forthcoming. 87 min: Ojo surges up the right side and pulls it back to Coutinho at the top of the area but his one-time shot is saved. Liverpool will have a corner. 83 min: Two more subs. For Liverpool, Ojo enters for the goal-scorer Lallana. For Newcastle, it’s the former LFC midfielder Jonjo Shelvey on for Cheik Tiote. 81 min: Liverpool work it up the right flank again and the ball is sent into Sturridge, who heads it weakly toward the goal where the keeper easily scoops it in. 80 min: The corner is turned away but Liverpool have another chance when the ball falls to Stewart, but his one-time shot sailed high and wide over the goal. 78 min: We’re into the final quarter hour and Liverpool have a corner after Lallana surges toward the goal and it’s pushed out by a defender. 75 min: Benitez with Newcastle’s second switch: Cisse off for Mitrovic. 71 min: Two subs for Liverpool. Lucas and Coutinho entering for Randall and Allen. Milner will shift to right back. Newcastle counter after Sturridge loses possession and Jack Colback rips a shot that’s deflected past Mignolet into the goal. As @thisisanfield notes, it’s the second time Liverpool have surrendered a two-goal advantage against the team from the Northeast this year. 62 min: Another Liverpool corner is turned away. Good counter-attack by Newcastle and the ball is out for a corner. It’s played short and sent into the area, but Stewart meets it in the air and heads it away. 60 min: One hour down and Liverpool appear to have regained their footing after going on walkabout for the first five minutes of the half. 59 min: Milner’s service into the area is headed into the back of the net by Allen but Firmino is ruled offside. It was close but replay confirms he was off by half a yard. 56 min: Moments after Milner is show yellow for a clattering challenge, he wins a free kick from just near the corner flag. He sends it into the Newcastle area but it’s easily cleared. 52 min: Sturridge tripped inside the area and appeals for the penalty, but while he’s still on the ground Newcastle are countering brilliant. It’s Cisse by himself on the edge of the area but he takes one touch too many, Liverpool’s defenders close in and somehow they escape it. It really should be 2-2! And Newcastle start the second half with the spark and verve they showed to end the first. A long cross from Anita toward the back post is headed home by Cisse and the Toon are back in business! 46 min: Newcastle have made one change at half-time: Ayoze Perez exits for Georginio Wijnaldum. Speaking of, Uefa have issued a statement on Sakho. UEFA would like to confirm the information communicated by Liverpool FC regarding an adverse finding in a doping test of their player Mamadou Sakho conducted at the UEFA Europa League match between Manchester United FC and Liverpool FC on 17 March 2016 (1-1). The player and the club have received all the pertinent information and have until Tuesday to request the analysis of the B ssample as well as to provide explanations for the presence of a prohibited substance in the players’ body. There are no disciplinary proceedings opened at this stage. Look who’s been spotted at Anfield. A comfortable opening half for the Reds, who answered the bell nicely with an early goal from Sturridge and Lallana’s follow-up. 44 min: Another shot for Anita, one that sails high and wide over the goal, but no doubt Newcastle’s strongest patch today. 41 min: Signs of life from Newcastle as Anita is played through up the right side and sends it into Cisse, whose header is thudded just wide of the goal 37 min: A note from JR in Illinois, via email: I can’t quite believe that nobody (save for a very brief mention by announcer Gary Weaver) seemed to notice the incident about 30 seconds before Sturridge scored. I went back and watched it several times. Mignolet came out of his goal to punch the ball. Not only does it clearly look like the ball was outside the box but Mignolet also cleaned Perez’s clock. Looked an awful lot like two yellow card offences. Weird. Must confess I missed it myself. Will review at the half. 36 min: Another chance for Liverpool as Firmino surges up the right flank and sends it into the area. It appears to be handled by a defender but appeals for a penalty go unacknowledged by the referee. 35 min: Firmino nearly makes it 3-0 on a point-blank chance from inside the area, but a last-gasp challenge by the center back interrupts. 33 min: Tiote, already on a yellow, throws down Joe Allen near the touch line and appears to be a red card waiting to happen. Almost looks like he wants to get sent off. Lallana sends a beautifully struck left-footed curler into the top-left corner of the goal. Made it look so easy. A special goal. Moreno again with the assist. 23 min: Newcastle barely showing a pulse at the moment. A punchless performance so far to be sure. They enter today’s match on a run of nine straight away defeats. The club record is 10, set back in the 1930s, so history may be afoot. 21 min: Newcastle win a corner and it’s quickly cleared. Tiote shown yellow for a cynical foul on Lallana as the midfielder tries to key a Liverpool counter-attack. 20 min: More great interplay from Liverpool up the right flank. They’re really in fine form at the moment. 18 min: A ball is played through to Sturridge, whose quickly struck left-footed shot toward the upper-right corner of the goal just misses the mark. 16 min: Liverpool threatening again as the ball caroms off a series of defenders in the area. Firmino finally directs a shot toward the goal, but it’s turned away. 14 min: Liverpool’s center back Dejan Lovren is down and the medical staff are out to treat him. He’s sitting up now and Martin Skrtel has sprung from the bench to loosen up, but it looks as if Lovren will re-enter the match. 11 min: Liverpool threatening again after a bit of a rudderless stretch in the middle third. It’s Lallana evading defenders on the edge of the area trying to pick out Sturridge but his pass misses the target. 8 min: The referee stops play as Moreno is down with an injury. 5 min: What a start for Liverpool. The Kop faithful had yet to even finish their first-minute tribute to Benitez – you can probably guess the song – when Sturridge found the back of the goal for his fourth goal in five matches (and seventh in 11 career matches against Newcastle). 4 min: Newcastle win a corner but nothing comes of it and within moments Liverpool move it down the pitch into the final third and are threatening again. The match is a scant 68 seconds old when Sturridge times his run perfectly, traps a long pass from the halfway line, clinically spins around two defenders and thumps it past the keeper into the back of the goal. A dream start for the hosts. 1 min: And we’re off! Liverpool attacking left to right toward the Kop end in all-red strips, Newcastle from right to left. Some thoughts Liverpool’s manager in today’s match programme. Hello and welcome to today’s Premier League tie between Liverpool and Newcastle. The Toon are locked in a relegation battle and currently within two points of safety after a mid-week draw with Manchester City. A win today would lift them out of the drop zone, but three points could prove a tall order against a surging Liverpool side on a run of four straight wins across all competitions, most recently a 4-0 triumph over Merseyside rivals Everton on Wednesday. With about a half hour between now and kickoff, here’s a look at today’s teams. Liverpool XI: Mignolet, Randall, Toure, Lovren, Moreno, Stewart, Allen, Milner, Lallana, Firmino, Sturridge Subs: Ward, Skrtel, Smith, Lucas, Coutinho, Ibe, Ojo Newcastle XI: Darlow, Anita, Lascelles, Mbemba, Dummett, Townsend, Tiote, Colback, Sissoko, Perez, Cisse Subs: Woodman, Mbabu, Shelvey, Wijnaldum, Aarons, De Jong, Mitrovic Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not check out Andy Hunter’s preview of today’s match. Rafael Benítez’s return to Anfield as the interim manager of Chelsea in 2013 was overshadowed somewhat by Luis Suárez’s bite on Branislav Ivanovic. He heads back seeking a favour from his old club in his attempt to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, but Liverpool are not in the form to give one – regardless of what team Jürgen Klopp selects. With Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals to come next week, Klopp may revert to the much-changed lineup that beat Bournemouth last Sunday. But there’s also been big news from Anfield already …\n",
      "Southampton 0-2 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Here’s Dominic Fifield’s match report: That was an extremely impressive performance from Chelsea, perhaps their best of the season. Their defence didn’t give Southampton a sniff, and Eden Hazard and Diego Costa were full of menace on the break. Since moving to a back three they have won four league games in a row by a combined score of 11-0. They are less adventurous than the three sides above them but they look dangerous and durable. Thanks for your company, night. 89 min Diego Costa is replaced by Michy Batshuayi. He had a terrific game. 87 min Chelsea bring on Branislav Ivanovic for the impressive Victor Moses. 85 min Austin has a goal disallowed for offside after robbing David Luiz. It was the right decision, though it was extremely close. 84 min Another excellent Chelsea attack. Costa curls a long pass to the wing-back Moses on the right. He runs across the line of the box, uses Willian by not using him and belts a left-footed shot that is too hot for Forster to hold. 81 min A summary of this match. 78 min Substitutions galore. Chelsea introduce Willian for Pedro; Southampton bring on Sam McQueen and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for Dusan Tadic and Ryan Bertrand. 76 min Southampton almost pulled one back. Martina’s curling cross was met at the near post by Davis, who headed it onto the challenging David Luiz. From there it looped over Courtois and onto the top of the bar. 74 min Chelsea have been brilliant in the second half. Before half-time they were excellent defensively but offered almost nothing going forward. Since the break they could have scored four or five. 71 min Hazard almost repeats his goal against Manchester United last week. He ran at Martina on the left of the box, moved the ball infield and drove it low across goal. It wasn’t quite in the corner, however, and Forster got down smartly to his left to save. 69 min Bertrand breaks down the left and wafts a nice cross towards Austin, who gets above Cahill on the six-yard line but thumps his header over the bar. That was Southampton’s best chance of the match. 68 min Southampton have only had one shot on target, Tadic’s free-kick in the first half. That tells you how well Chelsea have defended. 67 min This game is done. Chelsea are in full catenaccio mode and Southampton have no answer. 63 min How did that stay out? Moses’s shot was spilled by Forster to Hazard, who calmly squared it across the six-yard line for Costa. Forster was out of the game but there was a defender on the line and Costa, for some reason, tried to give the goal to Pedro. His pass was slightly behind Pedro, who was eventually crowded out by the defence. It was lovely play from Hazard, reminiscent of Karel Poborsky’s brilliant assist for Vladimir Smicer in the 3-2 win over the Netherlands at Euro 2004. 61 min Southampton make their first change, with Clasie replaced by Sofiane Boufal. 58 min Almost a third goal for Chelsea. Hazard’s low cross to the near post is swept over the bar by Costa, who was under pressure from the sliding Fonte on the six-yard line. 57 min This has been an immaculate away performance from Chelsea. It’s hard to believe it’s just over a month since they were a mess at Arsenal. This is a wonderful goal from Diego Costa! Chelsea took a short free-kick on the left, where Hazard gave the ball to Costa. He moved infield and them, just from just outside the box, smacked a magnificent curling shot into the far corner. Brilliant. He was helped by some half-arsed defending from Martina, who couldn’t be bothered to close him down properly, but it was still a fantastic goal. 55 min Chelsea look very comfortable defensively, and a bit more purposeful in attack than they were in the first half. This is their best spell of the game. 52 min Chelsea counter-attack promisingly until Alonso picks the wrong option, a shot from 25 yards, and executes it dismally. 50 min Matic heads the corner over the bar. 49 min Fonte saves a goal with a crucial interception. Kante drove a crossfield pass to Alonso, who delivered a beautiful low cross along the six-yard line. Fonte, sliding towards his own goal, knew he had to do something because Hazard was behind him waiting to score, and he just managed to slice it wide of the far post from a corner. 48 min Southampton have some decent attacking options on the bench, including Boufal, McQueen and Hojbjerg. I suspect they’re going to need them. 46 min Southampton kick off from left to right. Peep peep! Half-time reading Peep peep! Chelsea have done an efficient number on Southampton, scoring early through Eden Hazard and defend in the Serie A style. Southampton have not played badly at all but they are really struggling to add the progression to their possession. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+1 min Southampton appeal for a penalty when Austin goes over after an aerial challenge with Kante. There was nothing in that. 44 min “Shearer last night said that Aguero is the only world-class player in the Premiership,” says Ian Copestake. “Given there are only about five world class players in the actual world then perhaps his comment has no actual shock value.” 43 min Austin does exceedingly well, Mr Kipling, to win a corner for Southampton. Bugger all happens from the corner, however, so he needn’t have bothered. 41 min Matic robs Clasie and plays a gentle through pass for Costa. He lumbers into the box and whacks a low shot that is kicked away by Forster. That’s a crucial save because you can’t see Southampton coming back from 2-0 down against this defence. 38 min Good play from Hazard, who veers away from Van Dijk and Romeu 20 yards from goal before hitting a low curling shot that is comfortably saved by Forster. 33 min A desperate clearance from David Luiz finds Hazard on the left. He has a great chance to put Pedro through on goal but mishits his crossfield pass. Eventually it comes to Moses, whose shot deflects wide for a corner. 31 min This is almost like a training session, with Southampton attacking and Chelsea defending. Chelsea look superbly organised at the back and Southampton can’t make any progress. 27 min Alonso shoves Tadic over 25 yards from goal. He’s been the weakest of Chelsea’s back seven thus far. The free-kick is a far way to the right of centre, and Chelsea only have a three-man wall. Tadic curls it low around that wall and Courtois plunges to his left to palm it round. 23 min Tadic started the match superbly but hasn’t been involved much in the last 10 minutes. For all their nice passing, Southampton haven’t really got behind Chelsea. 21 min Davis’s corner from the left is headed back to him by Cahill. He lobs another cross beyond the far post, where the under-pressure Fonte can’t direct his header on target. 20 min Hazard looks menacing every time he gets the ball. After missing almost all of last season through apathy, he is fit and firing again. 17 min “I’m glad to see Chelsea finally showing signs of change after playing in a similar way regardless of manager,” says Nas Iqbal. “Conte’s trust in Luiz and Moses is reaping big rewards right now.” They look formidable defensively now, with three centre-backs and Kante and Matic in front of them. Good luck getting through that mob. 16 min Southampton win a corner on the left, play it short and make a balls of it. 14 min Davis’s inswinging free-kick from a narrow position to the left is headed well wide by Austin, lurking near the penalty spot. That was a decent chance but he got far too much on the header. 13 min Southampton have responded well to going behind, with some confident, easy passing. 9 min “I still have not quite recovered from the cricket this morning, me not being the type to be glad of a loss despite the incessant practice,” says Ian Copestake. “So I hope Southampton can build a good lead before tea.” 8 min This has been a cracking start to the match, and Redmond almost slithers through the Chelsea defence at the other end. He would have done so but for that pesky Matic, who made an excellent interception. 7 min As Gary Neville says on Sky, “once you’re one against one with Hazard in the box, you’re dead”. He beat Davis easily and then cracked the shot through Forster. Chelsea take the lead! It’s a classy goal from Hazard, who is starting to look back to his best. He moseyed over to the right side of the box to receive a return pass from Moses, turned inside Davis and belted a low left-footed shot through the legs of Forster. 5 min Tadic picks up a loose ball on the edge of the box and hits a shot that is well blocked by Matic. Moments later, after Tadic makes a fool of Alonso, Romeu hooks a bouncing ball over the bar from 30 yards. 3 min “Okay Rob,” says Matt Loten, “first poser of the afternoon for you: what is Pedro doing right to keep Chelsea’s best player of last season, Willian, on the bench? Don’t get me wrong, the Spaniard has plenty of qualities - you don’t play in that Barcelona team without qualities - but to my mind Willian is a far more consistent threat, and better at playing the ball between the lines. His free kicks aren’t half bad either. Is Conte just sticking with a winning team, or is Pedro really the better choice?” Willian is probably a better player but I’d say Pedro suits the 3-4-3 system a bit better. Also, Pedro was superb last week so I’m sure there is an element of not changing a winning side. I can’t see Willian being on the bench for long, especially as you could play him in a few positions. 2 min Hazard makes a good angled run to the right of the box before crossing towards Costa at the near post. His attempted shot is blocked by a defender and dribbles through to Forster. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea kick off from left to right. They’re in blue; Southampton are wearing the usual red-and-white stripes. The players emerge from the tunnel into the cool Southampton air. The weather’s nice. A little brisk. Everton beat West Ham 2-0 in the first match of the day. You can read all about it here. Southampton (4-D-2) Forster; Martina, Fonte, Van Dijk, Bertrand; Romeu, Davis, Clasie; Tadic; Redmond, Austin. Substitutes: Taylor, McQueen, Yoshida, Hojbjerg, Ward-Browse, Boufal, Olomola. Chelsea (3-4-3) Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Costa, Hazard. Substitutes: Begovic, Ivanovic, Terry, Chalobah, Oscar, Willian, Batshuayi. Referee Mike Jones Chelsea are the team of the season so far. No, you big eejit, I don’t mean they’ve been the best team, but they are the team who best reflect the old-fashioned unpredictability of the 2016-17 Premier League season. In the first few weeks, when they picked up all those points through late goals, they were apparently the likeliest challengers to the Manchester clubs. Then they were an in-transition shambles who even lost to Arsenal. Now, after Antonio Conte’s switch to three at the back, they are apparently the likeliest challengers to Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool. William Goldman was right: nobody knows anything. So we might as well just enjoy what looks like a cracking game between Chelsea and the always admirable Southampton. Chelsea are the only team to win a league match at St Mary’s this year, a reflection of how tricky a match this is likely to be. A win for Chelsea would take them within a point of the top three; a win for Southampton would take them above Manchester United. Kick off is at 4pm. Rob will be here soon enough. Until then, read Antonio Conte’s thoughts on fruit and varying formations: Under Antonio Conte Chelsea’s stomachs are settling. It has been a fraught 12 months but three Premier League wins of increasing significance have brought a pronounced change in tone and the manager’s tweaks, both on and off the pitch, appear to have swiftly borne fruit. In fact fruit is only part of it. Conte’s reputation for keeping firm control over his players’ diets preceded his arrival in July and, in relaxed form at Cobham before Sunday’s visit to Southampton, he explained that his insistence on balanced food intake stems from a penny dropping late in his playing career.\n",
      "José Mourinho criticises ‘cautious’ Liverpool after bore draw at Anfield José Mourinho accused Liverpool of being the cautious team in a dour goalless draw and insisted Manchester United’s meagre possession statistics represented a problem for Jürgen Klopp only. United nullified a Liverpool side who had scored nine goals in their previous two home games, with Mourinho selecting a defensive line-up and seeking to hit the lone striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic with the long ball. Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Wayne Rooney were all on the bench while Anthony Martial was absent due to a training-ground injury. Yet Mourinho claimed it was Liverpool who approached the north-west duel with a defensive mind-set due to the presence of Emre Can and Jordan Henderson in central midfield. “We stopped them playing but they also did very well from the defensive point of view,” said the United manager. “They played Can and Henderson for some reason and they did that for 90 minutes when they normally project more players in attack. They were very cautious. They kept always Can and Henderson in position. They had only one player behind the three more offensive players. I think it was their intention to try and control us, which they also did well.” Mourinho appeared aggrieved by the praise Liverpool have received for their attacking play this season and argued that Paul Pogba’s latest subdued display was the result of Klopp’s defensive strategy. He added: “You know, I think like everybody else, on the defensive side of the game he was perfect. Even the goalkeeper [David de Gea] was on holiday for 90 minutes but he had two big saves to do and he did. When we recovered the ball I was expecting the team to be more dangerous, but I think we still had some important chances and Liverpool did too. They are a very good team. You like to say they are the last wonder of the world in attacking football but they are also a team that defends and thinks defensively. The fact they play Can and Henderson together and control the position where Paul wants to control. We thought there’d be only one player there but they played with two.” United’s total of 35% possession was the club’s lowest in the Premier League since Opta began compiling statistics in 2003, but their manager even turned that into an issue for Liverpool rather than his own team. “Last season United won here when Liverpool had 14 shots on target and United had one,” Mourinho said. “How many shots on target did Liverpool have on target today? Two. Two shots on target with 65% of possession, you have to be critical of Liverpool. It is their problem, not our problem.” Klopp claimed Liverpool lacked patience in possession and made life difficult as a consequence for Daniel Sturridge, who was replaced by Adam Lallana after 60 minutes. The Liverpool manager said: “I am not too happy. The game from the first second was very hectic and maybe that was what Manchester United wanted and we didn’t want, maybe it was more for their advantage. That can happen from the start but you have to find your way back to the way we usually play. We lost patience far too early and our passing game was not good. We had 65% possession but we have to do better. I didn’t expect we would have 10-15 chances. Second half we had chances but De Gea was finally warm and he made brilliant saves. They had that chance with Ibrahimovic. “The best news tonight is we have one point more and a clean sheet, nothing else. We can do much better and we must do much better. We have to stay cool. When they want to chase us, we have to use counter-movements. We had these situations but in the last third we lost patience. It was like ‘Give it to Daniel’. It was a very difficult game for a striker. There was a really good attitude from my side. They tried everything, only with the wrong tools.” Mourinho is under investigation by the Football Association for commenting on the referee Anthony Taylor’s appointment before the game. Afterwards he commented: “Can I speak about the referee without being punished? He had a good game and I am happy for him because people with responsibilities put a lot of pressure on him and it was very difficult for him to have a good performance, which he had.”\n",
      "Slaven Bilic: It’s no good if West Ham always need to score three goals to win Slaven Bilic does not want his players to look up or down. He does not want them studying the fixture list. West Ham United’s manager will be happy as long as they relax, play with passion and quality and, as the old cliche goes, take each game as it comes. “You can’t approach it differently,” Bilic said. “You can’t approach it like ‘today, we are home to Crystal Palace, three points, and then Arsenal, one point’ because this happens.” From Bilic’s perspective, Mark Clattenburg happened. Clattenburg was an unpopular man around Upton Park because of his controversial decision to send off Cheikhou Kouyaté for a high challenge on Dwight Gayle midway through the second half, allowing Crystal Palace to snatch a late equaliser and stall West Ham’s push for Champions League qualification by securing a 2-2 draw. Three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, West Ham were furious. They will appeal against Kouyaté’s red card and feel that they are not getting the rub of the green with officials at the moment, thinking back to Chelsea’s dodgy late penalty in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on 19 March and Anthony Martial’s equaliser in the 1-1 draw in their FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United being allowed to stand, despite Bastian Schweinsteiger’s foul on Darren Randolph. For all their indignation, however, there is an argument that West Ham could have done more to kill off their opponents in all of those games. Having recovered from the sloppy defending that allowed Damien Delaney to give Palace an early advantage, they led 2-1 at half-time, thanks to Manuel Lanzini’s equaliser and Dimitri Payet’s fifth direct free-kick in 2016. Dropped points from winning positions cannot simply be put down to referees; a touch more ruthlessness and West Ham would be fourth. “Okay, fair enough but it’s no good if you always need to score three goals to win,” Bilic said. “I’m not talking that you can win the championship or whatever with winning 1-0, 1-0, 1-0 because it is not only about your defence, it is also about the opponent. But you can’t always score three goals.” West Ham made errors for both Palace goals, a defensive calamity allowing Gayle to equalise with 15 minutes left, and Bilic hopes his back four will be more solid, with James Tomkins, on the bench here, available after two months out with a calf injury. With Sam Byram also missing, Michail Antonio has been used as a makeshift right-back and he was targeted by Palace’s flying wingers, Yannick Bolasie and Bakary Sako. The return of Tomkins is a timely boost as West Ham approach a defining period. With fourth place and an FA Cup semi-final against Everton up for grabs, they host Arsenal in the league on Saturday and United in the Cup four days later. “We have a big enough squad, a lot of energy and a lot of confidence,” Bilic said. “Ginger Collins and Sam Byram, they are going to come back. Even without, we would go for both, try to finish as high as possible and try to reach the semi-finals.“ Palace are already in the semi-finals. Yet their FA Cup run has not been matched by their league form. Although it was an improved display against West Ham, a draw stretched their winless Premier League run to 14 matches and kept them seven points above the bottom three. Alan Pardew mentioned those alarming statistics in a meeting with his players on Friday night. “That was a normal, tactical meeting but probably a little bit longer than most. I just wanted to question the players and ask whether they actually realise what has gone on. Did they know the figures that the press have been using about us because you’d be surprised. “The players don’t always take on board what has been going on. They go into training and their view is that: ‘Oh, it’s the next game.’ Of course, as managers we are overloaded with stats and information. So I just wanted to remind them of where we were and I think I got a good response.” Pardew was asked if the players were aware of the numbers. “They certainly knew after,” he said. “I made it very clear about my feelings. That is all you are going to get.” Man of the match Bakary Sako (Crystal Palace)\n",
      "West Ham’s Andy Carroll twists knife into Bob Bradley and Swansea It was an afternoon when the mood turned ugly in South Wales as Swansea City supporters called for Bob Bradley to be sacked and vented their anger at the members of the board who sold their shares in the summer. “We want Bradley out” and “You greedy bastards get out of our club” were among the chants reverberating around the stadium during another chastening defeat for a team who look resigned to relegation. The only festive cheer was found in the away end, where the euphoric West Ham fans celebrated a third successive victory that lifted Slaven Bilic’s side up to 11th and piled the misery on to Swansea and their American manager. Bradley put on a brave face and all indications are the Swansea board have no desire to dismiss the man who was appointed in October, yet there is no escaping the level of discontent that was swirling around the Liberty Stadium in the second half. The atmosphere felt poisonous and it was not only the hardcore support, in the upper tier of the East Stand, who were calling for Bradley to go. At one point near the end that “We want Bradley out” chant swept around the stadium as fans railed at the sight of their club sliding towards the Championship. Bradley was never a popular choice at the outset and the results since his appointment have done nothing to change opinion. Swansea have picked up only eight points from his 11 games in charge and, most damningly of all, conceded 29 goals. The West Ham defeat was the eighth time under his watch that Swansea have shipped three goals or more in a game. It is a woeful record, yet Bradley is not solely responsible for the way that Swansea’s season has unravelled. Their recruitment in the summer was desperately poor and it is tempting to wonder how much better any other manager would do with the group of players Bradley inherited when he replaced Francesco Guidolin. Defensively Swansea are a shambles. Bradley has tried just about every permutation possible with the back and yet nothing seems to get any better. Some of his tactics in other areas make no sense and it was a curious decision on Bradley’s part to leave out Fernando Llorente, who had scored four goals in his previous two home matches. Borja, the £15.5m club-record signing who has scored only once all season, started in place of Llorente and was dragged off at half-time. By that stage Swansea were a goal down after yet another piece of calamitous defending. André Ayew, returning to the club where he finished as top scorer last season, registered his first goal for West Ham with a simple tap-in. Winston Reid added the second early in the second half and it was at that point that the frustration in the stands started to boil over. Michail Antonio later added a third and although Llorente pulled one back for Swansea late on, Bilic’s side were not finished. Andy Carroll, volleying home at the far post, twisted the knife with a fourth to re-establish their three‑goal advantage. Swansea face Bournemouth at home on Saturday, and travel to Crystal Palace three days later. Whether Bradley will still be around for both of those games remains to be seen. Whatever the board thinks privately about wanting to give Bradley more time, the manager’s position will become close to untenable if Swansea lose in front of their own fans against Bournemouth. “In terms of trying to win back a bit of belief from the supporters, Bournemouth couldn’t be bigger,” Bradley said. For West Ham, who have collected 10 points from their past four matches, the world seems a much happier place. They brutally exposed Swansea’s defensive frailties and never looked back from the moment Reid headed in Dimitri Payet’s corner five minutes into the second half. West Ham’s breakthrough in the first half had owed much to Carroll, who towered above Angel Rangel to head Mark Noble’s diagonal pass back across goal, and also Lukasz Fabianski’s poor goalkeeping. Fabianski carelessly pushed the ball into the path of Ayew, who slotted home from inside the six-yard box. Although Darren Randolph made a couple of decent saves to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jack Cork, Swansea never threatened to mount a fightback. There is no conviction about their play and it was no surprise when Antonio stabbed home a third, turning in Havard Nordtveit’s wayward shot. Llorente, on for Borja, reduced the deficit when he converted Nathan Dyer’s cross but Carroll put a smile back on Bilic’s face with West Ham’s fourth goal. Not that the West Ham manager is taking anything for granted. “It would be suicidal to think we are safe now and look only who is above us,” Bilic said. “It is still very tight but we have to use this to gain confidence and continue to improve. Only then we will have a chance to finish good.”\n",
      "Reform call will mean sweet FA unless Premier League excesses are curbed There are, inevitably, mixed feelings about seeing past chairmen and directors of the Football Association speaking out now about the need to curb the Premier League’s power, given their propensity mostly to do nothing about it when they had the chance, in the actual job. That might be unfair to David Triesman, who was savaged by the Premier League during his unhappy stint as chairman for daring to assert the primacy of the FA, but the reform proposals of David Bernstein and Greg Dyke, which they failed to secure, always seemed aimed more at the FA itself, and in office they were not noted critics of the Premier League. Dyke, characteristically vocal now, famously told the in an interview while he was the chairman of football’s still-distinguished and historic governing body, that he had so much money personally, he “didn’t give a fuck”. Yet rather than revel in that personal financial independence by taking on the billionaire vested interests of the Premier League for the game’s greater all-round good, Dyke somehow ended up implementing a redundancy programme at the FA itself, sacking 100 people, some of whom are still not in work a year on – so presumably still have to “give a fuck”. The busyness of Damian Collins MP, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, drafting yet another backbench bill to reform football – this one a vote of no confidence in the FA, which seems a little over the top – is meaningless without government support. Collins is a Conservative, so he could be doing the difficult job of seeking to persuade his colleagues in government that although they have one or two fine national messes of their own to salvage, they should make time for football reform as a priority. Without it, this is more talk, of which there has been a great deal over the past 24 years, in which the rehabilitated, seated, moneyed new age of the Premier League has been accompanied by unease and disillusionment over its hyper-commercialisation and inequality. Every parliamentary inquiry since the new Labour government’s Football Task Force of 1997 has taken evidence, had a solemn think and reached the same conclusions. Football has wonderful traditions in England, support for the game is phenomenal, but the 1992 breakaway of the then Football League First Division clubs, so as not to share their pay-TV bonanza with the rest of the game, rocket-fuelled the necessary modernisation of the sport with a culture of greed. During these discussions the FA’s executives, including some of these five who are public reformers now, have resisted that analysis and stood in a huddle with the Premier and Football Leagues against the campaigns of supporters, assuring governments that all is well. These five should nevertheless be listened to because they are clearly speaking from experience about the inability of the FA to govern the Premier League “juggernaut”. The most insightful point in their letter to Collins is that even the money the Premier League does now distribute, which is only around 6% of the £8bn being reaped by 20 clubs from their latest 2016-19 TV bonanza, “is wielded to assert beneficial positions for the Premier League”. The crumbs for the Football League have regularly been given with an ultimatum from the Premier League chief executive, now executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, that if the 72 clubs did not accept rules, for example on youth development, all the funding would be cut. For all the private grumbling, the Football League has meekly fallen into line over the years, rather than lose a million pounds here or there for each Championship club. Scudamore, of course, represents rich clubs now mostly owned by overseas investors, who bought them as assets to make money for themselves from the boom in the TV rights. His job is to achieve that for them, for the “shareholders”. Alan Pardew slipped out last week a reflection that the US investors in his club, Crystal Palace, “perhaps don’t know a lot about football”, but that is another truth that mostly dare not speak its name and it was reported as a faux pas by Pardew. There were positive results from the Football Task Force; the Premier League was pressed into distributing money for the first time to grassroots facilities: 5%, via the Football Foundation. The Burns review, a reform document of moderate ambition focused on the FA, at least resulted in independent chairmen and now two non-executive directors for the FA, which led to Triesman, Bernstein and Dyke fulfilling the role. Over time, these public outcries, combined with increased professionalism of clubs, has led to a more rounded, socially responsive approach than the unattractive money frenzy of the Premier League’s first few years, which made the first fortunes for the selling English owners. Scudamore has also learned when facing these regular challenges how to lobby governments about the Premier League’s Hollywood‑style TV dominance internationally and demonstrate the extensive community work that clubs have developed at home. The perennial result has been that governments have soon been won over by the Premier League’s success story and, rather than seek to curb its excesses, have tended to snuggle up for reflected glamour. There is no sign so far that this government will be any different, so when Collins’s committee hosts the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, on Tuesday perhaps he and his fellow MPs could put her through some of the same righteous interrogation they seem to like dishing out to the FA.\n",
      "Dennis Viollet: A United Man review – Manchester United survivor turned American pioneer Here is a respectful profile of Manchester United forward Dennis Viollet, who had an eventful enough life in the English game: he was part of the original Busby Babes, survived the Munich air crash, claimed United’s record for most league goals in a season (32, it still stands), before being shipped out by Busby to Stoke after developing a reputation as a bit of a party animal. Even with United’s sizeable fanbase, it’s hard to see how any of this is worthy of wider interest than a slot on MUTV – until it becomes apparent that Viollet’s career had an interesting second act: he moved to the US in 1969 and helped set up professional soccer there. It seems that Viollet took readily to life in the US, attempting to nurture homegrown talent alongside the starry imports, and he is spoken extremely fondly of by some of the former players whom he coached. The film is directed by Viollet’s daughter Rachel, which makes it very much a family affair.\n",
      "Homecoming: a starstudded psychological thriller in podcast form In the post-Serial world, drama podcasts have been upping their game and now Homecoming (iTunes, Gimlet Media) takes the format to another level. It’s impossible not to become immersed in the opening episode of the psychological thriller. Catherine Keener stars as Heidi Bergman, a caseworker from an experimental facility who’s helping soldiers integrate back into the community. She’s focusing on Walter Cruz (Star Wars’ Oscar Isaac), who is trying to live a normal life and keep his inner darkness at bay. It’s not easy, as he reveals his thoughts about harming himself: “I saw the desk and I just imagine leaning way back and slamming my forehead into the corner as hard as I could, over and over, into my eye,” he tells her. “But that was an extreme. It’s not like that all the time.” Bergman is keen to take a holistic approach, which is not good news for Colin Belfast, her take-no-prisoners boss, played by David Schwimmer. He is heard rushing through the airport, tripping over a little girl’s backpack as he instructs Bergman to “get really granular with all that shit”. He even provides a moment of light relief. “This is a walkway!” he rages, incredulously. “All right. Goodbye. Good talk.” Homecoming is the first scripted series for Gimlet Media, producers of podcast hits such as Heavyweight, StartUp and Reply All. The quality of the acting draws you in, then stops you in your tracks. (Arrested Development’s David Cross and comedian Amy Sedaris are also on the cast list.) It nails the feeling that characters are doing what they’re supposed to do, rather than standing huddled around a microphone. Subtle sound effects, such as a fishtank bubbling away in the background, and not-so-subtle ones like the noise of a busy airport, make it more akin to a lavish TV production than a staged radio drama. As the narrative flips back and forth from Heidi’s time as a caseworker to five years later, when she’s waitressing, mystery surrounds what brought her there. Ending on a cliffhanger after only 19 minutes, Homecoming leaves you wanting more. Good job there’s another five episodes in the first season. If you like this, try this: Limetown, a mysterious tale of a place where everyone disappeared.\n",

      "Louis van Gaal admits ‘sad’ Manchester United unlikely to make top four Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester United are unlikely to secure a top-four finish and described his side’s 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Sunderland as a sad day for the club. Van Gaal lamented that United failed to cope with the home side’s aggression. “I have told the players the top four will be very difficult now,” said the United manager, whose team are six points behind Manchester City, who are in the final Champions League spot. “You cannot close your eyes to that. It’s still possible but very difficult. We needed the points so much, everybody is very sad.” Wayne Rooney suggested that it would now be easier for United to earn a place in next season’s Champions League by winning the Europa League. “It will be very difficult to qualify for the Champions League through the top four now. We know that. It’s a sad day for us,” said the United captain. “Winning the Europa League might be the only way we can get into it.” Van Gaal conceded that such an achievement will be not be straightforward. “The Europa League is easier for us but also not so [easy] because there is a fantastic level of European football in that cup.” United’s Europa League campaign, after they dropped down from the Champions League, starts on Thursday with the first leg of their last-32 tie against Midtjylland in Denmark. United had come undone in the face of Wahbi Khazri’s excellent set-piece execution – Sunderland’s Tunisian playmaker scored one goal straight from a free-kick and delivered the corner that led to the winner, with Lamine Koné’s header going in off David de Gea. Van Gaal is well aware that the talk about José Mourinho succeeding him at Old Trafford in the summer is most certainly not going to go away after United’s first defeat at the Stadium of Light. Damningly, United’s points and goals scored tally is their lowest at this stage of a campaign in the Premier League era. “We can only blame ourselves,” said Van Gaal, who did at least see Anthony Martial score a fine equaliser before his players folded under Sunderland’s second-half onslaught. “You have to win this type of game but we could not cope with Sunderland’s aggression and set pieces. We didn’t deliver and we feel disappointed and we feel sad. But we are working together.” When asked if he was feeling the pressure, the Dutchman’s reply suggested a measure of resignation. “No,” he said. “I’m doing my work and I can do no more.” He accepts, though, that his best currently represents underachievement. “You cannot close your eyes from the top four being a minimum requirement. As Manchester United you have to keep the ball in spite of the pressure of Sunderland and create chances, but we didn’t have control.” The result meant Sunderland ended a bad week with a measure of satisfaction, moving to a point below 17th-placed Norwich. The club sacked Adam Johnson after the winger pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. They head for a training break in Dubai within touching distance of safety and Allardyce was delighted to see his £14m investment in Khazri, from Bordeaux, and Koné, a centre-half from Lorient, pay dividends. “Our new players have made a massive contribution and hopefully that bodes well for the rest of the season,” he said. “Today showed me the squad is good enough to get out of the trouble we’re in. It was a really good performance with the right result. We’re getting better.”\n",
      "UK health experts call for ban on tackling in school rugby More than 70 doctors and health experts have called for a ban on tackling in school rugby games. In an open letter that warns of the high risk of serious injury among under-18s playing rugby, they urge schools to move to touch and non-contact versions of the game. A government drive to boost participation in rugby in English schools by linking them with rugby clubs is also criticised by the health experts, who point out that the UN convention on the rights of the child obliges governments to inform children about injury risks. The letter – which is addressed to ministers, chief medical officers and children’s commissioners – describes rugby as a “high-impact collision sport”. “The majority of all injuries occur during contact or collision, such as the tackle and the scrum,” it says. “These injuries, which include fractures, ligamentous tears, dislocated shoulders, spinal injuries and head injuries ,can have short-term, life-long and life-ending consequences for children.” The letter is the first stage of a campaign that will include a petition on the change.org website which, if it receives 100,000 signatures, will trigger the consideration of a debate by MPs on the issue. Rugby is a compulsory part of the physical education curriculum from the age of 11 in many boys’ schools, particularly in the independent sector. The letter, signed by sport scholars, academics, doctors and public health professionals, says repeat concussions have been found to have a link to cognitive impairment, and an association with problems such as depression, memory loss and diminished verbal abilities. Children also took longer to recover to normal levels on measures of memory, reaction speed and post-concussive symptoms. The signatories included Prof Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health research and policy at Queen Mary University of London, who has campaigned about the dangers of rugby. Stating that children are being exposed to serious and catastrophic risk of injury, she said: “Parents expect the state to look after their children when they are at school. Rugby is a high-impact collision sport and given that children are more susceptible to injuries such as concussion, the absence of injury surveillance systems and primary prevention strategies is worrying.” Eric Anderson, a professor of sport, masculinities and sexualities at the University of Winchester, said the signatories did not have a contention with rugby, but with the collisions that occur in the sport. “School children should not be forced to collide with other children as part of the national curriculum for physical education,” he said. “A more sensible approach is to play tag rugby.” A Department for Education spokeswoman saidschools were expected to be aware of the risks associated with sporting activities and to provide a safe environment for pupils. “Team sports, such as rugby, play an important role in developing character,” she said. “They can help children and young people develop positive traits, such as fair play, leadership and resilience, and teach them how to bounce back from defeat, how to respect others and how to work together in teams to achieve a goal. “We have given schools the flexibility to organise and deliver a diverse and challenging PE curriculum which best suits the needs of their students.” The Rugby Football Union said it took player safety “extremely seriously” and that recent changes meant young players underwent a “gradual and managed” introduction to the contact version of the game. A spokesman said the union had also carried out a three-year injury prevention and surveillance study on schoolboy injuries, as well as implementing a guidance programme known as RugbySafe. He added: “We believe that high quality coaching, officiating, medical support and appropriate player behaviour in line with the core values all contribute to reducing the risk of injury occurring.” • This article was amended on 2 March 2016. An earlier version referred to the petition on the government, rather than the change.org, website.\n",
      "José Holebas’ stunning strike lands spoils for Watford at Middlesbrough By the time the final whistle blew, the morning’s clouds and rain had cleared to leave the splendour of the Cleveland Hills clearly visible from the main stand. The only problem for Aitor Karanka was that the sun elected to shine on Watford rather than his increasingly struggling side, with José Holebas’s glorious winning goal highlighting Middlesbrough’s mounting problems. With Álvaro Negredo and Gastón Ramírez once again letting themselves down, Karanka’s horizon darkened appreciably as Boro rarely looked like curtailing a plummet down the table during which they have collected two points from six games and lost four of the past five. Their sole win came at Sunderland’s expense. Karanka blamed this latest setback on Watford’s ability to waste time – a black art apparently cultivated by their manager, Walter Mazzarri – but the visitors would not have been able to slow things down with such cute gamesmanship had Boro proved capable of stringing more than two consecutive passes together. “They made it impossible to play our game, it was impossible for us,” lamented Karanka before defending his hallmark 4-2-3-1 system which some observers feel is turning into a straitjacket for Boro’s players, partly explaining why they have not won at home since April. “We have a style,” the Spaniard countered. “I’ve built the squad to play that way, we won promotion with one up front. With that style we have a good chance. We have to keep going. It’s just October so we have a long time to go.” Mazzarri affected to be taken aback by the time-wasting accusations. “I don’t know what he refers to,” he said. “Honestly, I don’t think so.” The Italian then reminded everyone that Boro’s Antonio Barragán should have been sent off for a second yellow-card offence in the first half. “We all know the rules and it was very evident. But I don’t comment on referees.” Without a ball being kicked, the team-sheets alone created a measure of controversy. While Mazzarri preferred Isaac Success’s attacking potential to that of Odion Ighalo, Karanka recalled Negredo and Ramírez, leaving Jordan Rhodes and Viktor Fischer warming the bench. When Younès Kaboul – operating on the right of Watford’s back three – swiftly turned slapdash and conceded possession the former pair had a chance to show Boro fans what they were really capable of but, after exchanging passes with Negredo, Ramírez dragged a scuffed shot wide. Watford initially looked vulnerable but Boro’s problem was that Ramírez – deployed in the No10 position behind Negredo that is so key to Karanka’s configuration – seemed to have developed an unfortunate penchant for persistently picking the wrong pass. Even when he took a corner, the Uruguayan Ramírez overhit it, leaving the ball sailing out of play. Negredo was similarly off key but, in mitigation, that pair were hardly helped by Marten de Roon’s lack of control in a midfield anchoring role. Seeking a lucky break, Boro appealed for a handball penalty against Nordin Amrabat but, correctly, Roger East, the referee, refused to buy it and boos rang around a stadium studded with empty red seats. The stay-aways quite possibly called it right. Although Watford improved as their formation gradually morphed from 3-4-3 to a defensive 5-4-1, the general standard was poor with far too many miscued passes and suspect first touches. If Karanka had reason to be content with Calum Chambers’ and Ben Gibson’s containment of Troy Deeney, Boro’s manager must have been relieved that Barragán was not dismissed after committing that second bookable offence. Already handed a yellow card for hauling down Success, the right-back was fortunate to escape a second for pulling back the same player 10 minutes later. It seemed one of those afternoons when there would be more bookings than shots on target but Watford emphasised their efficiency by scoring with their first. Pouncing on a Boro clearance, Holebas took a steadying touch, before unleashing an elegant yet vicious 25-yard left-foot shot which defied the stretching Víctor Valdés en route to the top corner. After that it was all about Boro’s lack of a Plan B and Watford’s Italianesque determination to hold on to the win. Perhaps fortunately for Karanka, local anger was directed towards East. “We’ve had some shit refs but you are the worst,” they chorused after Holebas tripped Chambers on the edge of the area and no penalty was awarded. Replays showed the contact came fractionally outside the box. Indeed, the referee was the wrong target; arguably East’s only key mistake was not handing Barragán a red card for that second bookable offence and, wisely, Karanka refrained from criticising him. Right now a manager who surely delayed too long in liberating Rhodes from the bench has bigger things to worry about.\n",
      "Strikes have no winners – and the junior doctors’ dispute is no exception Most strikes end sadly, and some – like the miners’ – very badly. Junior doctors have yet to vote on the peace terms agreed by their leaders on Wednesday, but the odds are that most will accept. Yet they will stay angry, and with good reason. After eight strike days, the public has stayed staunchly supportive of their cause, even when they walked out of A&E, and even when tens of thousands of operations were cancelled. But there is an ebb and flow, a rhythm in the emotional rollercoaster of a strike, and the time feels right to call it a day – before public support wanes, and when the junior doctors know their point about life within the NHS has been well made. But nearly all strikes end with a painful sense of giving in, by a workforce driven back to work – even when they have won important concessions. The rhetoric, the political passion, the indignation all have to be toned down, in ways that make the workforce feel they are swallowing more pride than the employers are. It hurts – and the bitterness lasts. That’s why strikes are usually a bad thing, a last-resort breakdown in relations. The thrill of rebelling is intoxicating, but usually ends in burst-balloon disappointment. I have covered hundreds of strikes, but rarely seen happy workers marching back in with a sense of victory. The latest I wrote about was the well-justified strike by National Gallery staff: settlement didn’t leave them a happier workforce. Jeremy Hunt provoked this strike, possibly deliberately, imagining he would emerge a hero to his party for taking on the “vested interests” of the public sector. But he ended up the political loser, with the public understanding the doctors’ alarm at the state of his NHS and the rising pressures on all who work in it. Digging through the details of the actual deal, neither side won. It looks more like a stalemate, with some changes around the edges. Hunt’s claim to have got seven-day working – but with no new money, inside the same pay envelope while conceding on some of the more extreme antisocial-hours issues – looks like magical accounting. Besides, during the course of this long strike, the original research suggesting 11,000 more patients die after admission at weekends has been decisively shredded: it’s all in the different case-mix at weekends. Nor, if there are genuinely extra deaths at weekends, is there any evidence that junior doctors, who work more weekends than other staff, are the key. Nor, say health economists, is there any evidence that heavy investment in extra weekend staff delivers good value for money in lives saved, compared with other spending. But health is politics. Hunt wanted a fight, and he got one, but it has ended any leadership hopes he once had. No tears shed there. Far worse is the long-term effect this will have on the junior doctors themselves. Many more are likely to flee abroad or go into some other occupation after experiencing the grinding exhaustion and high anxiety of their job being met with such cynical political ingratitude and incomprehension. The shortage of doctors is acute, and some specialisms can’t fill their rotas. Nurses too are in critically short supply. Why anyone would think this is a good time to end bursaries for trainee nurses is a mystery. The NHS itself is now registering its worst ever results since waiting times were recorded: for A&E, operations, cancer treatment and ambulance times. As the situation worsens, this strike, with its popular support, will have helped place the blame firmly where it belongs – with a government that pretended to promise ringfenced funding, but which has given the NHS its lowest increase over the last six years than at any time since 1948 – 0.8% against an average 4% rise to cover a growing and ageing population. The UK is tumbling down the international league table for health spending. Frankly, the wonder is how well it has managed, when many health economists predicted it wouldn’t. But the pressure building up in lack of staff will blow the lid off, as overstretched managers try to keep the wheels turning while repairing the unfathomable organisational mayhem caused by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Even if they vote to accept the deal, even if they feel deflated, as all strikers do, the junior doctors will have scored an important victory in telling the public exactly what’s happening inside the NHS.\n",
      "Watford v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over! Manchester City end their poor run of form on the road by snatching victory from Watford with two goals in the final 10 minutes. For the second match in succession, Watford lose out to a late sucker punch, but their fans can take great heart from a fine performance in defeat. They remain in ninth place in the Premier League table, while City stay in third, three points behind leaders Arsenal. 90+4 min: Watford embark on one last attack, with Cathcart sending the ball long to Troy Deeney. He attempts to find Ighalo with a header, but Joe Hart clears up for City. 90+3 min: Aleksandar Kolarov is forced to intervene as Ighalo attempts to control a headed through ball from Troy Deeney. 90+2 min: Ighalo wins a throw-in deep in Manchester City territory and the ball makes it’s way to Allan Nyom on the right flank. He stands the ball up for Ben Watson in the penalty area, but Joe Hart punches clear. 90 min: The fourth official suggests four minutes of added time. Can Watford rescue a point? They almost certainly deserve one, having played so well and lead until the 81st minute. 87 min: Ighalo spurns a wonderful chance to restore parity for Watford, swivelling to shoot straight at Joe Hart from seven or eight yards out after latching on to a through ball from Geudioura. 87 min: Watford substitution from a few minutes ago: Adlene Geudioura on for Jose Jurado. Manchester City substitution: Martin Demichelis on for Sergio Aguero. 85 min: That was a fine goal from Aguero. Running down the right touchline on the overlap, Bacary Sagna swung a cross into the edge of the six yard box. Bursting between Watford’s centre-backs, Aguero leapt to send a header into the bottom corner. Sergio Aguero puts Manchester City ahead with a fine header from the edge of the six-yard box. 83 min: That was a brilliant finish from Yaya Toure. As Aleksandar Kolarov shaped to take a corner, Toure jogged into position about 10 yards from goal in line with the near post. With his marker standing behind him, he made his unstoppable volley past Gomes look completely effortless. Don’t be fooled - his technique was flawless. 81 min: Yaya Toure equalises with a splendid near post volley to convert an Aleksandar Kolarov corner. That’s a wonderful finish. 79 min: Etienne Capoue advances into Manchester City territory, nutmegs Sergio Aguero on the edge of the penalty area and shoots high over the bar when he should have scored. 77 min: Allan Nyom kicks fresh air while attempting to clear a bouncing ball, allowing Kevin De Bruyne to drill a cross into the penalty area. They survive the scare and clear. 75 min: Bony is quickly into action, but not quite quickly enough. Despite his best attempts, he’s unable to get to a low cross from Kevin De Bruyne before it rolls into the arms of a grateful Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal. 74 min: Almen Abdi drags a shot well wide from distance. Manchester City substitution: Wilfried Bony on, Eliaquim Mangala off after another torrid day at the office. 72 min: Yaya Toure has a pop from about 25 yards out, but drags his daisy-cutter well wide of the left upright, earning himself hoots and whistles of derision from various Watford fans. 71 min: Nothing comes of the corner as the game enters its final 20 minutes. 69 min: Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva exchange passes in a wonderful one-two just outside the Watford penalty area. From the edge of the D, DeBruyne unleashes a low, venomous drive that looks to be heading for the bottom lewft-hand corner until Heurelho Gomes dives to put it around the upright for a corner. 67 min: Kevin De Bruyne gallops down the left flank before pulling the ball back into the path of Yaya Toure in the penalty area. It’s a glorious scoring opportunity, but the big Ivorian sends the ball high over the cross-bar. 65 min: Jesus Navas gets in behind Holebas on the right flank and sends a looping cross into the Watford penalty area. It’s cleared. 64 min: City win a corner. With the ball arrowing towards Fernandinho on the edge of the six-yard box, Etienne Capoue does just enough to knock him off his stride and prevent an equaliser. Fernandinho goes to ground and appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. 63 min: More pressure from Watford, with left-back Jose Holebas jinking his way past two City defenders, before unleashing a shot that takes a deflection off one of his team-mates and going wide for a goal-kick. 62 min: From the right flank, Allan Nyom sends a cross into the City penalty area, but Otamendi heads clear. 60 min: With half an hour to go, City are struggling away from home once again. Watford are showing no signs that they intend to sit back and try to protect their leaqd and continue to take the game to their visitors. 59 min: Watford win a free-kick in the centre-circle for a push in the back by Aguero. Manuel Pellegrini makes his first change, removing Raheem Sterling and replacing him with Jesus Navas. 56 min: Originally, there was a suggestion that Watson had scored directly from the corner, but replays show that Kolarov helped the ball on its way with a glancing header. Without Kolarov’s intervention, Joe Hart would almost certainly have punched clear, so Kolarov will be credited with the goal. But in a world where so few players are capable of taking corners properly, Watson can be very pleased with his assist. Watford win a corner, which Ben Watson curls in towards the near post. His inswinger is sublime and Aleksandar Kolarov can only head it into his own net as he attempts to defend it. Watford lead 1-0. 53 min: A chance for City! From the corner, Fernandinho gets a free header, but sends his effort over the bar. 52 min: Sterling plays the ball wide to Kevin De Bruyne on the left flank and he cuts inside and takes a shot, which is deflected out for a corner. In the penalty area, Silva has a go at De Bruyne for not playing the ball into his path. 52 min: Sterling tries to prod the ball in behind the Watford defence for Sergio Aguero to chase, but his attempted pass is blocked. Aguero’s seen very little of the ball this evening, which seems surprising considering the talent of his support network. 49 min: Good defending from Sagna, who hooks the ball clear as it bounces across the edge of the six yard box. He needed to be decisive, as Troy Deeney was lurking with menacing intent behind the full-back, waiting to pounce on any scraps that came his way. 48 min: From the corner, Hart punches clear, Watford enjoy a period of sustained pressure until Fernandinho sticks a boot in and tries to send Sergio Aguero on his way with a long ball up the field. There’s too much welly on his through ball, which Aguero is unable to latch on to despite staying onside. Gomes mops up at the back for Watford. 47 min: From a throw-in, the ball finds it’s way to Ben Watson on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area. His low drive was heading wide, but not by so far that Joe Hart didn’t feel compelled to dive and turn it around the post for a corner. 46 min: Abdi sends the ball wide to Allan Nyom, who plays it back inside to Ben Watson. Britos, Holebas and Capoue all get early second half touches as the home side spray the ball around the field in search of an opening. Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney get the second half party started, with no changes in personnel instigated by either manager at the break. It’s all square at half-time in a match Watford dominated in the opening stages. Manchester City played their way back into the game and dominated for 20 minutes or so, but Watford probably had the better of the closing 10 minutes of the half. Both sides have had their chances - although Watford’s were more clear cut - and level-pegging seems fair enough at the interval. Here’s hoping for more of the same in the second half. 44 min: The fourth official suggests one additional minute of added time. 42 min: Fernandinho is penalised for a foul on Etienne Capoue, giving Watford a free-kick about 50 yards from the City goal. Ben Watson aims for the head of Miguel Britos as the centre-half darts into the penalty area. He wins the ball, but not cleanly and Manchester City are able to clear their lines. 39 min: Watford win a free-kick some distance out from the City goal, which Ben Watson sends into the penalty area. The ball’s cleared, but only as far as Jose Jurado on the angle of the penalty area, left-hand side. With Deeney, Ighalo and others calling for a cross, he attempts to curl the ball into the top right-hand corner. His effort sails wide of the angle of crossbar and upright. 38 min: Allan Nyom tries to make his way into the Manchester City penalty area, only to find his path blocked by Fernandinho. The Manchester City midfielder shapes to tackle the right-back, only to pull out of the challenge. Unperturbed, Nyom goes to ground anyway, flinging himself theatrically in a manner that earns him a yellow card. He can have no grumbles about that one. 37 min: Watford attack on the break, with Abdi galloping down the right flank. Fernandinho does well to get back and dispossess the winger with a good tackle. Watford were breaking in numbers and his intervention was crucial. 36 min: Having been dominated for 10 or so, Watford enjoy some moments of respite as they get the ball out of their own half for the first time in what seems like an age. 33 min: Having picked up a pass from deep from Toure, Sergio Aguero is unable to make room for a shot himself, but picks out Kevin De Bruyne in space in the penalty area. His effort is blocked and rebounds into the path of David Silva on the edge of the penalty area. The Spaniard shoots, but De Bruyne is unable to get out of his way and unintentionally deflects the ball away from the target. It goes out for a corner, from which nothing comes. 31 min: Now it’s Kolarov’s turn to have a potshot. His effort fizzes over the bar. 30 min: As Manchester City begin to dominate, Sergio Aguero shoots wide from a promising position. 29 min: David Silva links up well with Fernandinho as they charge down the inside right channel. A promising move comes to naught when Raheem Sterling blasts over the bar following Watford’s failure to clear an attempted David Silva bicycle kick properly. Moments before Silva’s acrobatic effort, Fernandinho had a shot saved by Gomes. 28 min: Raheem Sterling picks up the ball on the left flank, makes his way past Allan Nyom, only to run a blind alley with Craig Cathcart waiting in the shadows. The Watford centre-half robs the winger of possession and clears. 26 min: With Toure back on his feet, play resumes. David Silva wriggles his way down the inside right and into the Watford penalty area, but is unable to get a cross in to Sergio Aguero, who’s cutting a rather forlorn figure. 24 min: Yaya Toure goes down holding his left shin after a bruising challenge from behind by Almen Abdi. The Watford midfielder seems lucky to have avoided a booking there. 22 min: It’s worth noting that the previous corner was conceded by Eliaquim Mangala, who’s being given the absolute run-around by Odion Ighalo. Mangala looks a bag of nerves and looks good for at least one bit of slapstick defending that could result in a Watford goal. 21 min: Watford win a corner, which Ben Watson sends into the mixer. The ball drops out of the night sky, bounces off Craig Cathcart’s thigh and into the hands of Joe Hart. Cathcart didn’t seem to be expecting that - had he been more alert, he could have converted a fairly easy chance from no more than seven or eight yards out. 19 min: Kevin De Bruyne tries his luck from distance, with a clever shot that pitches up just in front of Heurelho Gomes, but the Brazilian goalkeeper isn’t unduly troubled by the audacious effort. 17 min: Watford win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Manchester City goal. Ben Watson and Jose Holebas stand over it as Joe Hart instructs his defensive wall. Watson, who headed Wigan’s winner against City in the FA Cup final three years ago, takes the free-kick, but his effort is poor. The ball sails high and wide of Joe Hart’s goal. On Sky Sports, co-comms man Alan Smith suggests he should have taken advantage of the wet conditions and greasy surface to shoot low and hard in a bid to test Joe Hart. 13 min: With his back to goal on the edge of the City penalty area, Ighalo demonstrates a wonderful first touch to turn Otamendi and leave himself with only Joe Hart to beat. The City goalkeeper rushes off his line to smother the ball, which breaks in the penalty area. City’s desperate defenders manage to prevent any Watford players from converting the rebound. This is a cracking game - long may it continue. 11 min: With Troy Deeney through on goal after an idiotic pass from Otamendi, Aleksandar Kolarov performs heroics to get back and muscle him off the ball. Deeney goes down in a heap and there’s a huge shout from the stands for a penalty, but Martin Atkinson doesn’t give one. Replays suggest it’s the correct decision. 9 min: With Eliaquim Mangala caught out of position, Nicolas Otamendi does well to get back and cover as Odion Ighalko attempts to latch on to a long ball through the centre. His excellent covering tackle results in a corner for Watford, but nothing comes of it. 9 min: Etienne Capoue miscontrols a pass in midfield and cedes possession to Yaya Toure, who advances. The ball finds its way to Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal. 8 min: Raheem Sterling gets on the ball on the left touchline, cuts inside and links up with David Silva on the edge of the Watford penalty area. The hosts clear. 7 min: Capoue attempts to play the ball into the penalty area towards Ighalop and Deeney, but his intentions are well read by Kolarov, who heads clear. It’s been a lively, entertaining start from two teams who look fairly evenly matched at this early stage. 5 min: More good play from Watford out on the right flank, with Etieene Capoue and Abdi combining well. Making his way into the penalty area, the former goes down under a challenge from Mangala and appeals for a free-kick, but doesn’t get one. 4 min: With plenty of Manchester City players in the Watford penalty area, Aleksandar Kolarov blows a decent opportunity to deliver a good ball from, the left. 2 min: Almen Abdi takes the first shot in anger and it’s not too far away! After good build-up play in which Jose Jurado ghosted past Yaya Toure, the ball found its way to Abdi on the edge of the area. He unleashed a surface to air screamer that fizzed narrowly wide of the top right-hand corner. 2 min: Manchester City dominate possession in the opening exchanges, although Mangala is forced to put the ball out of play halfway inside his own half to concede a throw-in. 1 min: Manchester City get the ball rolling at Vicarage Road at referee Martin Atkinson’s signal. It’s wet and windy in Watford tonight. Not long now: The teams make their way out of the tunnel and line up for the pre-match niceties. Watford’s players wear their customary home kit of yellow shirts with thin black stripes down the front, black shorts and black socks. Manchester City’s wear their usual light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. They’ll be kicking off in a moment or two. It’s difficult to imagine tonight’s match concluding without a few goals, considering that Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo have scored 20 between them already this season in the top flight, while Manchester City’s front four of David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero are a fairly terrifying proposition for any defence preparing to face them. More than three goals is the shout for me, which means a dull scoreless draw is almost certainly inevitable. Their players are warming up wearing T-shirts designed by Callum Ballantine, a 19-year-old from Didsbury who recently died from a rare form of bone cancer and will auction them for charity after the game. Along with his friend Samir Kamani, Callum designed a “Made from Manchester” range of clothing to help raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Callum and Samir raised over £20,000 for the charity before the former’s sad death on December 20th. Hats off to the lad, may he rest in peace. Having just beaten Newcastle at the Emirates, Arsenal have extended their lead at the top of the table to two points, as Leicester could only draw at home to Bournemouth. A win for Manchester City this evening will keep them in third place, three points behind Arsenal and two behind Leicester. A win for ninth-placed Watford will see them overtake Liverpool and Crystal Palace by moving into seventh place. Watford: Gomes, Nyom, Cathcart, Britos, Holebas, Abdi, Capoue, Watson, Jurado, Ighalo, Deeney. Subs: Prodl, Behrami, Oulare, Guedioura, Berghuis, Anya, Arlauskis. Man City: Hart, Sagna, Otamendi, Mangala, Kolarov, Fernandinho, Toure, De Bruyne, Silva, Sterling, Aguero. Subs: Zabaleta, Fernando, Caballero, Bony, Jesus Navas, Clichy, Demichelis. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) Manchester City get another opportunity to arrest their puzzling slump in away form with a trip to Vicarage Road, where they’ll face a Watford side who’d won four and drawn one before Monday’s reverse at the hands of Spurs. City have failed to win any of their last six on the road, losing against Tottenham, Stoke and Arsenal in the process. If they are to beat Watford today, they will have to do so without Vincent Kompany, who is suffering from a calf injury. In better news for Manuel Pellegrini, Fernando, Fabian Delph and Gael Clichy are all available for selection after spells in the treatment room. For Watford, Nathan Ake will sit this one out on the naughty step after being show a straight red card for a high challenge on Erik Lamela shortly after the hour against Tottenham. Defenders Tommie Hoban and Joel Ekstrand also remain absent through injury.\n",
      "Laurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United Back in the height of summer when Petr Cech made his move across London, it was games as ragged and rickety as this that John Terry had in mind when he suggested the goalkeeper could be worth 12-15 points a season to Arsenal. Arsène Wenger’s team were below par, the radar was off, the fatigue had set in, and they came up against a Newcastle team who made more than enough chances to upset the league leaders. Cech dealt with assurance with Newcastle’s best efforts, which gave Arsenal the platform to eke out a win. Earning the points required resilience and the capacity to dig deep into their energy reserves. It was appropriate, perhaps, that the matchwinner was Laurent Koscielny, restored to the starting lineup after a much-needed breather. It was indicative of how this game went that Wenger confessed he felt for his opponents. “Honestly I am long enough in football to know if you are in Newcastle’s place you feel sorry for them because they played very well,” he said. “I know also when you are capable to win and you haven’t played well it shows a mental aspect of your team that is very important.” It left Steve McClaren ruing the outcome when he felt his players had earned the right to take something with them on the journey north. “I’m scratching my head as to how we got nothing from that game,” he said. “Not many teams will come here and do that to Arsenal without getting something. “We were aggressive, kept control, created chances. I couldn’t fault what we tried to do. It was the complete performance without getting a result. It’s about putting the ball in the back of the net which is why they have the points and we don’t.” Asked if the answer to his head scratching could take the form of a giant 33-year-old goalkeeper, McClaren did not disagree. “Goalkeepers win you matches and he certainly won that game,” he said. There were two particularly influential stops. In the first half Cech was alert to parry away Giorginio Wijnaldum’s firm shot, and tidy up when Jack Colback followed up. At the start of the second half Aaron Ramsey ceded possession and the game opened up once again for the visitors. Ayoze Pérez dinked a perfect pass for Wijnaldum. Cech spread himself to smother superbly. His interventions were hugely important on a day when Arsenal struggled to find their fluency. One of the perils of the festive football calendar is the likelihood of busy players looking as if they barely know if they are coming or going. There were leggy performances, lapses of concentration, and off-key passes scattered liberally across the drenched Emirates pitch. Wenger watched on from his dugout, quietly frustrated that his team were not functioning properly. Mesut Özil’s touch and movement were typically deft, but those around him strained to reach his level. The energy levels improved in the second half as the game opened up and both teams became more cavalier and increasingly desperate in their search for a goal. Newcastle came close as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba threatened. Arsenal perked up when Olivier Giroud flashed a header across goal, and then Özil squeezed a brilliant pass towards Ramsey, whose shot was too tame to test Rob Elliot. In need of some inspiration, someone to take a risk or try something to force the issue, Koscielny stepped up to deliver in the 72nd minute. Giroud won headers in the box not once but twice after Özil floated in a corner. Koscielny was alive to sneak in at the far post to plant a shot past Elliot. Wenger was more than satisfied with the outcome as an example they may need to draw on as the season wears on. “Not to drop points when you play like we did today is very important. It helps the team – the memory of having done that before and winning the game helps you to hang on sometimes.” Trying to look at the bigger picture, he was in no mood to read too much into this match in terms of the title challenge. “It’s too early. We have 42 points, let’s be realistic. “Let’s focus that we are in a strong position. We have given a lot over Christmas. At the end of the day how many points have you made in four games? We knew nine points would be acceptable, 10 ideal.” He made the point that only Manchester City managed 10 points last season. And they did not go on to win the Premier League. Wenger and McClaren were quiet about any potential business to strengthen their squads over January but admitted they are hard at work to bolster their options. The intensity of four festive games over, there is still not much time to pause for a moment, regroup, and go again.\n",
      "Walter Mazzarri hails Stefano Okaka after Watford rally to hold off Everton Ronald Koeman has made his reputation as a canny, pragmatic manager in the Premier League but his Everton side were made to look naive by Watford as they maximised their opportunities to take all three points. After being outplayed on the pitch, the Dutchman failed to cover himself in glory after the match either. Rightly furious at his team letting a 1-0 lead become a 3-1 deficit before Romelu Lukaku’s second restored a sheen of credibility, he described his team as “reactive, not proactive”. But he also saw fit to criticise, more than once, his opponents’ style of play. Walter Mazzarri smiled when he heard that the Dutchman had described his team as “direct and aggressive”. Yes, his side had scored twice from set pieces, and yes the move that led to their opening goal had begun with a long ball from the back. But Mazzarri knew what had happened on the pitch, and Watford had been better in every department. “Each person has his opinion, luckily we all have eyes to see,” the Italian said through his interpreter. “I think you have all seen who played better today, who played good football. Every person has an opinion, but I don’t agree with him.” Watford’s star performer was Stefano Okaka. The striker arrived from Anderlecht in the summer for an undisclosed fee but his season has been disrupted by injury. This was only his second start of the season, his first came last week, but he looked anything but rusty as he pirouetted to score Watford’s equaliser in the 36th minute. After Sebastian Prödl gave Watford the lead with a towering header in the 59th minute, Okaka produced one of his own four minutes later. He lost his marker to meet José Holebas’s corner at the near post and flick the ball past Maarten Stekelenburg. The Italian was withdrawn late on to a standing ovation. “I’ve known him since he was very young and playing for Roma, he’s a great talent,” said Mazzari, who gave the striker a bear hug after his opening goal. “We had the opportunity to sign him in the summer and we took it. He is perfect for the Premier League because he doesn’t only help himself but helps his team-mates to play well and score.” Where Everton would have been without their own two-goal striker is anyone’s guess. Lukaku opened the scoring when he coolly finished off Gareth Barry’s wonderful long ball, ironically Everton’s best pass of the game. The Belgian closed it out with a surefire header from the substitute Aaron Lennon’s cross. In between times, however, he was largely marooned, waiting hopefully for crosses that rarely came. After criticising Ross Barkley’s lack of productivity during the week, Koeman once again left the England international on the bench. His replacement, James McCarthy, looked entirely at sea in a nominal No10 role. Gerard Deulofeu tried hard on the right-hand side, while Kevin Mirallas was anonymous on the left. And these are the players who apparently make Everton more of a footballing side than their opponents. “The Premier League is not always about football qualities, it’s about physicality, about second balls and in that respect the team is too weak,” Koeman said. “We have too much to do when teams like this play direct and aggressive. “We have different players, different qualities but in that aspect we have to improve and do better. You can’t change that in two weeks. You need January, you need the summer to change what you need as a team. We need a better balance.” Everton had a late penalty appeal when Miguel Britos manhandled the substitute Enner Valencia to prevent him jumping for a cross but Watford now sit in the top half of the table, with Mazzarri about to get his first experience of the Premier League Christmas period. “In Italy we don’t have games so close at Christmas but I’m not worried about it,” Mazzarri said. “All I’m worried about is that my squad is not fully fit. If we had the complete squad I’d be very happy.”\n",
      "Deadpool review – crude superhero laughs “A fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break? That’s like… 16 walls.” This relentlessly self-referential antihero romp comes on like a slightly smug corporate riposte to Matthew Vaughn’s altogether more anarchic Kick-Ass, flipping the bird at its own heritage (the opening titles tell us that it’s produced by “Ass-hats” and directed by “an overpaid tool”) and cracking wise about how confusing these comic-strip timelines have become, and the cheapskate nature of the ever-expanding X-Men universe. Ryan Reynolds is the potty-mouthed avenger whose life is ruined when enforced mutation robs him of his Hugo Boss chops, leaving him looking “like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah”. Limb-lopping sweary ultra-violence ensues, offering a fairly consistent stream of dirty cheap laughs as Deadpool gets rear-ended by bullets and butt-plugs alike, while those around him lose their hearts and heads – but mostly their heads. Inevitably the final act descends into the usual punchy/smashy orgy of collapsing buildings that is a dreary franchise requirement. But for the most part it’s crudely disreputable fare, buoyed up by ironic bubblegum tunes (a Guantanamo-style torture montage to the strains of Mr Sandman is a nice touch) and driven by Viz-style “shit biscuit” profanity.\n",
      "Games based on pop stars, yesterday afternoon, a bin, root canals – we review anything The contents of a bin Listen, I’ve sunk pretty low for Review Anything on occasion. For reasons I still do not fully grasp, I once reviewed a woollen ball. I reviewed pegs. Sodding clothes pegs. And yet... this. This is the lowest I’ve sunk on behalf of this feature. Rifling through bins. Here is an image of the contents I uncovered: Here is my review of those contents: The wrapper: I don’t know what this wrapper is for because finding out would mean touching it. It looks crisp, clear and presumably wrapped whatever it was wrapping ably. The tissue: I do know what these tissues are for because I put them in there roughly half an hour before this photograph was taken. The tissues were soft – Sainsbury’s Super Soft Aloe Vera, if memory serves – and smelled very fine indeed. A second wrapper (to left of image): Bananas. This definitely contained bananas. Technically, bananas already come bunched and encased within natural wrappers, so this artificial wrapper seems slightly unnecessary. I would like to add a final note: the bin I reviewed had been emptied fairly recently. Yet more proof that the ’s superlative facilities department is second to none, but not exactly conducive to a thrilling review. The bin’s contents: 4/10 The ’s facilities department: 10/10 LH Computer games based on pop stars The final clause of this suggestion is music to any time-pressed anything-reviewer’s ears, and I’m no exception. Conducting a comprehensive survey of “computer games based on pop stars” would be an actual journalistic enterprise that could potentially involve time and/or effort, so thank God I only had to look at about six pictures before extrapolating some intrinsically worthless judgment. (There was a YouTube video of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood game, but the amount of information contained therein was clearly not just superfluous, but actively contrary to Whitlock & Pope’s requirements. So that’s 22 minutes of my life I still have today.) You might think the more information you have, the easier it is to review anything: not so. In fact, information often complicates the reductive summaries every reviewer longs to write. So what observations can I make about computer games based on pop stars using the limited materials I have at my disposal? Well, the pixels are relatively large. Sometimes they are brightly coloured, sometimes they aren’t. Granted, attributing any sort of value to these observations is not that easy, but that’s why we employ a numerical system! 4/10 RA A chunk of yesterday afternoon 16.24 and all is well 16.25 I think I get a fav on a tweet about how much I hate cars. But then it disappears. 16.25 Someone’s phone goes. It has the Opening (default) ringtone. Every time I hear that ringtone now I always think of the Kanye West song 30 Hours. In that song Kanye is interrupted by the Opening (default) ringtone and he says, “It’s Gabe calling.” When I hear the Opening (default) ringtone I often say “It’s Gabe calling” under my breath. 16.30 The BBC sport website posts “Lawro’s predictions”. This week he has gone head to head with Idris “Heimdall from the Thor movies” Elba to guess the results of this weekend’s Premier League football. Elba backs my team to lose at home against Sunderland on Saturday. I make a mental black mark against his name. 16.41 I start thinking about Corbyn: The Musical, which sounds like a load of self-satisfied rubbish and was written by a barrister with the face of a Victorian pie lover. It’s apparently full of cheap jokes at both the Labour leader’s expense and also, for some reason, prominent twitter feminists. I wonder what made the pie lover feel it was necessary to bring this to the world. 16.48 I google some quotes from The Big Lebowski. 16.53 I think a bit about giraffes and how sticky their tongues are. The sun comes out. 16.54 I think about how I am peckish, but yet not hungry. I wonder what this means. I decide that I have conditioned myself to be in a constant state of need, and that this is a consequence of living in a capitalist system. 16.59 I listen to Strive by A$AP Ferg and Missy Elliott. I can’t decide whether I like it or not. 17.00 I go into a meeting about the redesign of the Guide. It goes OK, but does drag on a bit. Overall this period of time was reasonably stimulating. But the period between 21.24 and 22.17 was to prove more stimulating. 6/10 PM Some dentistry I’m not entirely sure what a root canal is. I know what a canal is and I drank root beer once (mini Review Anything of root beer: vile. -10/10), so perhaps a combination of the two? What I do know is that people who have undergone root canal treatment talk about it in tones more commonly associated with survivors of combat. “You weren’t there, man! You didn’t have to endure what I had to endure.” I’ve always assumed these people were a bit, well, soft. I mean, come on, it’s a tooth. How unpleasant can it… Oh. OH! *runs to Luke’s bin to vomit* I’m so sorry for doubting you and your kind, Chris Adams. From the expletive in your tweet, I gather this was a particularly savage root canalisation, and I hope that you can at least find some inner peace in the future. 1/10 GM Got a suggestion for next week’s Review Anything?

      "Five of the best… films out now in the UK 1: Green Room (18) (Jeremy Saulnier, 2015, US) 95 mins This skilled siege thriller descends into horror when Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and co get holed up backstage at a lawless venue in the middle of nowhere, with Patrick Stewart and his neo-Nazi attack dogs baying for their blood. Be warned: the body count gets high. 2: Everybody Wants Some!! (15) (Richard Linklater, 2016, US) 117 mins America’s official youth historian casts his mind back to college life circa 1980: a time when disco was giving way to punk and men were inclined to sport tiny shorts, cut-off sleeves and handlebar moustaches. The focus this time is the jocks for a change, a campus baseball team whose pre-term bonding rituals, skirt-chasing expeditions and incurable competitiveness make for some delightful character comedy. 3: Mustang (15) (Deniz Gamze Ergüven, 2015, Fra/Ger/Tur/Qat) 97 mins In contrast to idyllic American boyhood, Turkish girlhood is literally a form of house arrest here. Life changes overnight for five orphaned sisters: from carefree school days to a regimen of curfews, virginity inspections and arranged marriages. Seeing the fate of her elder siblings, youngest sister Lale treats the situation like a prison break, which brings a note of tension into an all-too-believable scenario. 4: Captain America: Civil War (12A) (Anthony & Joe Russo, 2016, US) 147 mins The Marvel stable lines up behind either Chris Evans’s Captain or Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man for a superhero faceoff that lives up to expectations, and manages to touch on the real world in a way Batman v Superman didn’t. The comic-book character-packed cast makes it feel like another Avengers sequel; Avengers Disassemble, perhaps. 5: Son Of Saul (15) (László Nemes, 2015, Hun) 107 mins A Holocaust drama like no other, limiting its focus to a Jewish concentration-camp prisoner assisting the Nazis in the grimmest of tasks, while pursuing his own tragically futile agenda. We follow this stricken worker throughout, glimpsing the broader atrocities in the margins – but that is enough to communicate the full horror.\n",
      "Salomón Rondón denies Stoke first win with late equaliser for West Brom A first league victory of the season for Stoke was the only milestone that mattered to Mark Hughes on a day when Tony Pulis took charge of a team for the 1,000th time. Stoke looked on course for just that after Joe Allen scored in the 73rd minute. But they did not make it over the line, as Salomón Rondón headed into their net from a corner in stoppage time. Stoke used to celebrate late goals for Pulis’s team but they cursed this one. “It felt like a loss,” said Hughes, who could take encouragement from a strong performance by his team and the fact that a point was enough to hoist them off the foot of the table. Pulis, who has spent nearly half of his career in the Stoke dugout, was welcomed back warmly to his old patch but Stoke fans’ affections did not extend to the visiting players, whose every touch was booed from the first second. That reflected defiance in the face of Stoke’s poor start to the season and was combined with loud encouragement for the home team. Stoke’s players were similarly upbeat, betraying no sign of disenchantment, just a hunger to quash Albion. It made for a rousing first period in which clear chances were scarce but the threat of a breakthrough was always present. Albion were no bystanders, indeed they fired the first shot. But Rondón’s curler in the sixth minute whizzed wide, meaning that Lee Grant did not have to make his first Premier League save since joining Stoke on loan from Derby County in the summer. The 33-year-old was picked instead of Shay Given as part of Hughes’s plan to solidify a leaky defence. Although Rondón had three more shots off target in the first half, Stoke were on top. Their midfield, with Allen thriving in an advanced role, pestered the visitors relentlessly and, when they won the ball, attacked immediately. In the 25th minute Glenn Whelan pinged a cross to Wilfried Bony, who headed the ball across the six-yard box. Glen Johnson lifted it over the advancing Ben Foster, only for Craig Dawson to head off the line. Twice Eric Pieters fell under untidy tackles by Matt Phillips but no penalties were given. Hughes ran through the full Basil Fawlty routine – in his technical area so as not to incur another fine – but conceded after seeing replays that “both were close calls, in fairness”. Early in the second half Allen nearly gave Stoke the goal they craved but Dawson denied them again, deflecting the midfielder’s header over. Bony was the only home player to disappoint, strong in possession but lacking the mobility to be in regular synch with his team-mates. He was replaced on the hour by Peter Crouch. Stoke claimed the reward for their persistence in the 73rd minute when Xherdan Shaqiri crossed from the left and Jonny Evans failed to make a clean clearance owing to a challenge by Marko Arnautovic. Allen shot into the net from eight yards. He was a fitting scorer. “[Allen’s] got good anticipation of things dropping around the box and that showed for the goal,” said Hughes. “That’s why he left Liverpool, because he wanted to play week in, week out and we’ve given him the run of games. He’s been a shining light for us, he’s been the one hitting the levels we expect.” Grant preserved the lead with a fine save from a header by James McClean but he could not keep out Rondón’s header at the death. So it was yet another happy day at Stoke for Pulis. “The place is wonderful and the crowd were fantastic to me when I was here,” said the Albion manager. “It’s been stitched into my body this football club. I’ll always have respect for them.”\n",
      "Cameron’s cosy Christmas with Murdoch makes you admire Trump’s fighting talk Watch David Cameron start dropping round for seasonal drinks with Rupert and Rebekah again and it almost makes you warm to Donald Trump. The Donald wasn’t endorsed by New Hampshire’s most powerfully portentous newspaper for the coming primary test. The Union Leader is backing Chris Christie via a big front-page message from its publisher, Joseph McQuaid. But Trump doesn’t take it gently, or nip round for a quiet gin and tonic. “You have a very dishonest newspaper here,” he says. “It’s also a failing newspaper. It’s going down the tubes. I remember when this was the big newspaper. Look at the size of this, now. If they cut it down any more, you won’t be able to find it.” As for McQuaid? “I’ve watched this guy and, honestly, he’s a loser.” Pass the peanuts, prime minister. ■ Pundits looking back at 2015 may wonder who got the general election result right. Zilch, nada, humiliation (for everyone up to and including David Cameron). Or who, as Ed Miliband resigned, would succeed him as Labour leader. Nada continued. But at least we can all unite now to blame HMG for its pitiful flood planning and inept reaction to the great rains. As the Daily Express declared last April: “Hosepipe bans and speed showers could become the theme of the summer after experts warn that a drought could take over Britain.” Or, the same dear old Express warned last September: “Four months of heavy snow: Shock UK long-range weather forecast for THIS winter.” Drought, frost, tempest… It makes spotting the rise of Jeremy Corbyn seem a breeze. ■ When I wrote (30 December) about EU referendum deal negotiations, I mentioned different talks between the FT and its journalists’ union over pension changes. FT management wishes me to point out that they, not the new Nikkei owners, are pursuing these “for the long-term sustainability” of the paper – and that while 92% of NUJ members who voted (157 out of 171) wished to enable a strike, 89 other members didn’t return a ballot form. So “only 7% of FT employees” are involved in this dispute. Whether or not that makes for a happy new year we’ll have to wait and see.\n",
      "Premier League, Football League and European football: clockwatch – as it happened That’s it from me; here are some match reports to help you make sense of this afternoon’s action. Don’t forget to join Rob Smyth for Arsenal v Norwich. That should be fun. Cheerio! Premier League Newcastle are out of the bottom three with 33 points Sunderland are a point behind with a game in hand West Ham are up to fifth, five points off Arsenal in fourth Championship Sheffield Wednesday join Derby and Hull in the play-offs League One Wigan are promoted from League One after beating Blackpool Burton need a point to guarantee promotion to the second tier Doncaster are all but down after 3-1 defeat at Crewe Blackpool and Fleetwood will fight to avoid last relegation place League Two Accrington, Oxford and Bristol Rovers still in the promotion race Plymouth, Portsmouth and Wimbledon are all in the play-offs Drama at Moor Lane, where Salford City scored twice in the last ten minutes to beat Workington 3-2, seal promotion to the Conference North, and finally restore a smile to Gary Neville’s face. Championship Brentford 3-0 Fulham Bristol City 4-0 Huddersfield Ipswich 3-2 MK Dons Leeds Utd 1-2 Charlton Nottingham Forest 1-1 Wolves Reading 1-2 Preston Rotherham 0-1 Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 Cardiff League One Barnsley 2-2 Colchester Burton 2-1 Gillingham Chesterfield 3-0 Bury Coventry 3-1 Sheffield Utd Crewe 2-1 Doncaster (latest) Millwall 3-0 Oldham Rochdale 2-2 Swindon Scunthorpe 1-0 Port Vale Shrewsbury 3-4 Peterborough Southend 0-1 Bradford City League Two Barnet 3-4 Yeovil (!) Cambridge 2-2 Plymouth Carlisle 0-2 Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge 3-0 Crawley Exeter 1-1 Morecambe Hartlepool 0-2 Portsmouth Leyton Orient 1-0 Mansfield Newport 0-1 Notts County Northampton 2-0 Luton Stevenage 0-0 Wimbledon Wycombe 0-1 Accrington York 1-4 Bristol Rovers Everton 2-1 Bournemouth Newcastle 1-0 Crystal Palace Stoke 1-1 Sunderland Watford 3-2 Aston Villa West Brom 0-3 West Ham Sheffield Wednesday are in the play-offs after beating Cardiff 3-0 at Hillsborough, while Luke Varney has grabbed a late winner for Ipswich. Burton are on the verge of promotion after beating Gillingham 2-1, while Tom Lapslie has scored a last-gasp equaliser for Colchester at Oakwell. The U’s are already down, and had a forward in nets for the last ten minutes, so that’s impressive. At Crewe, Doncaster have around 20 minutes to realistically save themselves from the drop. Everton win, but there are plenty of banners up around Goodison Park calling for Roberto Martínez to go. Leighton Baines got the winner in the second half. All over at the Hawthorns, where West Ham keep their top four push alive thanks to two goals from Mark Noble, and one for Cheikhou Kouyaté. An Andros Townsend free kick, and a Karl Darlow penalty save from Yohan Cabaye, earn Newcastle a vital victory. Bryan Graham has more. Quite the game at the New Meadow, where Shrewsbury rallied from 3-0 down to level, only to slip 4-3 behind at the death. Now they’ve had Ian Black sent off. In League Two, it’s finished Cambridge 2-2 Plymouth; the visitors will be in the play-offs, Cambridge will not. Villa snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as Troy Deeney scores two stoppage-time goals to earn a useful win for Quique Sanchez Flores. Jermain Defoe wins and scores an injury-time penalty to earn a precious point for Sunderland. A Gareth Bale header settles a scrappy game, and Real are back on top in La Liga, for a couple of hours. Come on now, this isn’t fair. Troy Deeney strikes again to earn Watford victory, and somehow make Villa’s season worse. Scenes at the Pirelli Stadium, where Tom Naylor has put Burton 2-1 up in the 92nd minute! I’m so sorry, Villa fans. Troy Deeney nods a Berghuis cross into the net to equalise in stoppage time. Defoe takes an age to place the ball, then smashes it home to grab a point for Sunderland! Oh boy. Geoff Cameron brings down Defoe, who gets up to take the penalty... Real Madrid have a free kick to defend in added time, but Keylor Navas gets both hands to a near-post header. That should do it... At Stoke, Seb Larsson fires a free kick over, and Sunderland’s frustrations boil over, with a couple of minor skirmishes breaking out. They’re running out of time, as are Doncaster, who have gone behind at bottom club Crewe. If they lose, they’re as good as down. It gets worse for Plymouth, with James Spencer putting the hosts ahead, two minutes after their equaliser. That goal could keep Cambridge in the hunt for a play-off place themselves. Big goals crash in at Oakwell – where Barnsley lead 2-1 – and the Abbey Stadium, where Cambridge have equalised against Plymouth. That could condemn Plymouth to the play-offs. In the Championship, Stephen Quinn has equalised for Reading at home to Preston, in a game they’re racing to get over and done with. Ten minutes to go in the Premier League. Can Sunderland level? Will Newcastle hang on? Are Everton about to win at home? We’re about to find out. League Two news: it’s York 1-3 Bristol Rovers, and Accrington finally have the lead at Wycombe. All of the top six are winning, while there’s a cracker at Barnet, where Yeovil have just made it 3-3. Your thoughts “Gareth Bale redeems himself with a header à la Andy Carroll. Must be the topknot” says Charles Antaki. “Toooooooon!” bellows Sam Huscroft. The captain gets his second of the day, turning home Andy Carroll’s chipped pass. You know what to do, Roy... A big goal in La Liga, as Gareth Bale gets it right this time to head a Lucas Vasquez cross into the top corner! Alex Revell gets his second, and it’s inevitably Ipswich 2-2 MK Dons in a game between two sides who can’t buy a win. And Sheffield Wednesday are bound for the playoffs, as Gary Hooper robs David Marshall of the ball and crosses, with Cardiff’s Lee Peltier applying the unfortunate finishing touch. Oxford lead Carlisle 2-0, but they won’t be going up today – Bristol Rovers lead 2-0 at York, and Plymouth lead at Cambridge. In League One, Shrewsbury needed a win to secure survival. They’ve failed miserably, losing 3-1 at home to Peterborough. It had all been going too well for Aston Villa, and after Anya is put clear by Ben Watson, Cissokho brings him down with his trailing leg, and is sent packing by Anthony Taylor. Jackie Milburn, Alan Shearer... Karl Darlow. The understudy keeper denies Cabaye, and Newcastle stay in the lead. Moussa Sissoko handles from a Palace corner, and former Newcastle hero Yohan Cabaye is going to take it... Bristol City lead 3-0 over Huddersfield, Jonathan Kodjia with his second goal. Elsewhere in the Championship, Ipswich lead MK Dons 2-1 through Brett Pitman, and Forest have equalised against Wolves. No title for Bayern today, as Gladbach hold them to a 1-1 draw. They’re five points clear of Dortmund with two games remaining. Eintracht Frankfurt are out of the bottom two, with Werder Bremen dropping into danger. Bayern 1-1 Gladbach Darmstadt 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt Dortmund 5-1 Wolfsburg Hannover 1-3 Schalke Hoffenheim 2-1 Ingolstadt Mainz 0-0 Hamburg “Sunderland’s own Thomas Müller has not scored yet but I am sure he is working hard” honks Ian Copestake. Fabio Borini has now gone off, unappreciated once again. Big goal at Hillsborough, where Gary Hooper has put Sheffield Wednesday ahead, tucking away the rebound after Pudil’s shot was saved. The hosts set for the play-offs alongside Hull, Derby and whoever finishes third. Leighton Baines puts Everton back ahead, placing an Aaron Lennon pull-back into the top corner with aplomb. Joe Mason puts Wolves a goal up at Nottingham Forest, while in League One, Barnsley equalise at home to Colchester. Thank me later, Newcastle fans. Andros Townsend puts the hosts ahead from a free kick! Bryan Graham has more. “Gareth Bale has just missed not one sitter, but two in short order against Real Sociedad. Adopts the hands-behind-head plus anguished-distant-gaze appropriate to such occasions” reports Charles Antaki. He also looked for an offside flag to help him out – absolutely textbook. Can Newcastle take advantage of Sunderland going behind? They’re struggling at the moment. Get the latest with Bryan Graham. It’s a (relatively) good afternoon so far for teams already down: Bolton have won, Villa are winning, as are Charlton, Colchester lead at Barnsley, Crewe have equalised against Doncaster, and Dagenham & Redbridge lead Crawley 2-0. Here’s J.A. Hopkin with a fair point: Let’s talk about how the other three Champions’ League semi-finalists are playing today, but the FA and Sky Sports would not allow Man City to move tomorrow evening’s match away at Southampton to a Saturday kick-off. How’s that for supporting our home clubs in Europe? Manuel Pellegrini certainly isn’t happy: West Brom offering no threat to West Ham, with Andy Carroll coming closest to scoring in the second half. Hard lines for Spurs fans... Two big goals in the Bundesliga relegation race – Eintracht Frankfurt lead at Darmstadt, and Hoffenheim lead 2-1 at home to Ingolstadt. Elsewhere, Dortmund are sending a message to Mats Hummels – they’re now 5-0 up over Wolfsburg. Gillingham grab an equaliser at Burton through Cody McDonald. If it stays like that, Wigan will be champions, and Burton will be nervous. In the Championship, Ademola Lookman has doubled Charlton’s lead at Leeds. Grim news for Sunderland fans, Marco Arnautovic bullying Lamine Kone off the ball and firing Stoke into the lead. Aston Villa freewheeling at Vicarage Road, retaking the lead through Jordan Ayew, who fires a low shot beyond the grasp of Heurelho Gomes. Well then – Gladbach have equalised through Andre Hahn, and Bayern’s party is on hold. We’ve also got news from Crewe v Doncaster – don’t go thinking we’ve gone all continental on you. It’s 1-0 to Doncaster, who look set to keep their survival bid on track. Real Madrid fail to make a first-half breakthrough in a dull 45 minutes at the Anoeta. Championship A couple of late goals, with Jonathan Kodjia putting Bristol City ahead, and Alex Revell equalising for MK Dons. Brentford 3-0 Fulham Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Ipswich 1-1 MK Dons Leeds Utd 0-1 Charlton Nottingham Forest 0-0 Wolves Reading 0-0 Preston Rotherham 0-1 Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Cardiff League One Barnsley 0-1 Colchester Burton 1-0 Gillingham Chesterfield 2-0 Bury Coventry 2-0 Sheffield Utd Crewe 0-0 Doncaster (3.30 k/o) Millwall 2-0 Oldham Rochdale 1-2 Swindon Scunthorpe 0-0 Port Vale Shrewsbury 0-1 Peterborough Southend 0-1 Bradford City League Two Barnet 1-0 Yeovil Cambridge 0-0 Plymouth Carlisle 0-1 Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge 0-0 Crawley Exeter 0-0 Morecambe Hartlepool 0-0 Portsmouth Leyton Orient 0-0 Mansfield Newport 0-1 Notts County Northampton 2-0 Luton Stevenage 0-0 Wimbledon Wycombe 0-0 Accrington York 0-1 Bristol Rovers Everton 1-1 Bournemouth Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace Stoke 0-0 Sunderland Watford 1-1 Aston Villa West Brom 0-2 West Ham Kouyaté turns provider, teeing up Mark Noble who toe-pokes the ball into the bottom corner to put West Ham very much on top. Almen Abdi spoils Villa’s party, equalising on the stroke of half-time with a fine free kick. Granit Xhaka curls a shot just wide of Manuel Neuer’s far post, with Bayern still just a goal up. Dortmund keep up the pressure, Marco Reus making it 3-0 over Wolfsburg. Hope for Frankfurt, as Makoto Hasebe equalises at Darmstadt. Burton take the lead over Gillingham, Lucas Akins with the goal. Victory would put them six points and at least five goals ahead of Walsall, with two games remaining for the Saddlers. Millwall in fourth are 2-0 up over Oldham, but that’s no use unless Burton lose. Relegated Charlton lead Leeds 1-0 at Elland Road, in a match that I’ll wager is lacking a party atmosphere. At Goodison Park, Ross Barkley is trying to make something happen, but fires a shot into Stanley Park from a good position. “My local team, Eintracht Frankfurt, seem to be doomed” says Ian Copestake, who likes to spread his allegiances around. “Football God Alexander Meier needs to channel his inner Jay Jay Okocha”. Frankfurt are still a goal down at Darmstadt, and the marvellous Meier is set for a spell of being undervalued at a Premier League contender. Here’s our report from Bloomfield Road, where Wigan returned to the Championship in style, and Blackpool slid closer to League Two; they were in the Premier League five years ago. “There appears to be some mistake,” says Chris Drew. “You’ve got Aston Villa as scoring a goal. And even more unbelievable, they’re in the lead.” Dimitri Payet collects the ball out on the right, and delivers a superb cross for Chiekhou Kouyaté to nod the Hammers in front. Real Sociedad enjoy a spell of pressure, with Sergio Ramos of all people conceding a clumsy free kick – but two forwards get in each other’s way. One early goal in the Championship that passed me by: Blackburn lead Rotherham 1-0 through Shane Duffy. In League Two, Bristol Rovers lead at York, and Barnet are a goal up over Yeovil. In Scotland, Aberdeen aren’t giving up the title today, and they’re working on the 39-goal swing, leading 2-0 over Motherwell. Surprise! Ciaran Clark gets his head to a corner and nods Villa into the lead! They haven’t won away from home since August. Ben Watson hits the bar with an outrageous volley from distance, while at the Hawthorns, Jonathan Leko is lighting things up in an otherwise quiet game. David McGoldrick has put Ipswich a goal up against relegated MK Dons, while Sheffield Wednesday are knocking on the door against Cardiff. In San Sebastian, Gareth Bale flashes another header wide, the Welshman leading the line with Benzema and Ronaldo out today. “Are Leicester City going to party like its 1999 (see below), Manchester United’s treble winning year, when Manchester United, like Leicester City, only lost three matches during the Premier League season?” asks Raymond Reardon (presumably not that one). Let’s not talk about Leicester. You want to, I want to, but... ah, what the hey, let’s talk about Leicester. Peter Crouch flicks on Charlie Adam’s cross, but Marco Arnautovic can’t get their ahead of Mannone, before Kone throws himself in front of a Shaqiri shot. Nothing to trouble the scoreboard here, or at Newcastle, Watford and West Brom. At the Anoeta, Gareth Bale has planted a header just wide as Real Madrid search for an opener. Here’s the Bundesliga half times; Bayern are 45 minutes from the title. Bayern 1-0 Gladbach Darmstadt 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Dortmund 2-0 Wolfsburg Hannover 1-2 Schalke Hoffenheim 1-1 Ingolstadt Mainz 0-0 Hamburger SV Watford all over Aston Villa in the early stages, with the off-colour Odion Ighalo missing a couple of chances. In League One, Bradford lead at Southend, while in Scotland, Kilmarnock lead at Hamilton, pushing Dundee United closer to the drop. It’s a big day for Salford City – they’re up against Workington in the Northern Premier League playoff final, seeking elevation to the Conference North. It’s 1-1 after 15 minutes at Moor Lane. Fulham and Sheffield United fans, time to go out and enjoy the sunshine. Fulham are 2-0 down at Brentford, the Blades behind by the same score at Coventry. It takes a while to be officially given, but Marc Pugh turns Callum Wilson in off Matthew Pennington to level immediately. Boos from the crowd over a potential push in the build-up. Tom Cleverley gives the hosts a welcome lead, firing into the bottom of the corner from the edge of the area. Early goals in Leagues One & Two: Oxford lead at Carlisle with promotion in sight, while Northampton lead Luton through Zander Diamond. The champions will get their hands on the trophy at full-time, as my colleague Dan Lucas keeps reminding me. More Hillsborough tributes at St. James’ Park: “Rafa has made Newcastle my second team. The fans have just cranked out a thrilling rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone. Wonderful to see this in football” says Ian Copestake. I feel a little discombobulated after that emotional Everton tribute, but let’s press on with the football. All games are under way. At Goodison Park, a number of Hillsborough victims’ relatives are on the pitch, while the PA plays “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother”. During a minute’s applause, a banner is unfurled, it reads “Justice at Last 96 – Brothers in Arms”. “Due to unforeseen circumstances, that is, a win for Kilmarnock at Hamilton today, followed by a defeat for Dundee United at Dens on Monday, today’s Scottish football update has been cancelled. Sorry” sobs Simon McMahon. “But for anybody still interested it’s still quite exciting in the race for the Championship play offs between Falkirk and Hibs, and the bottom of League One between Cowdenbeath, Brechin and Stenhousemuir.” Simon is too depressed to mention Celtic, who have beaten Hearts 3-1 at Tynecastle. They will be confirmed as champions if Aberdeen fail to beat Motherwell, but the Dons need four wins, three Celtic defeats and a 39-goal swing. You can forgive Celtic for celebrating early. Roberts is on the bench at the Hawthorns today, and Pêl-droed is probably my favourite word for football in another language. Thomas Müller has put Bayern 1-0 up early on in Munich. Dortmund, as usual, are chasing gamely – they’re already 2-0 up in Wolfsburg, Shinji Kagawa and Adrian Ramos with the goals. Football League fixtures Championship Brentford v Fulham Bristol City v Huddersfield Ipswich v MK Dons Leeds Utd v Charlton Nottingham Forest v Wolves Reading v Preston Rotherham v Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday v Cardiff It finished Bolton 1-0 Hull in the early game; the visitors not exactly picking up speed as the play-offs approach. League One Barnsley v Colchester Burton v Gillingham Chesterfield v Bury Coventry v Sheffield Utd Crewe v Doncaster Millwall v Oldham Rochdale v Swindon Scunthorpe v Port Vale Shrewsbury v Peterborough Southend v Bradford City League Two Barnet v Yeovil Cambridge v Plymouth Carlisle v Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge v Crawley Exeter v Morecambe Hartlepool v Portsmouth Leyton Orient v Mansfield Newport v Notts County Northampton v Luton Stevenage v Wimbledon Wycombe v Accrington York v Bristol Rovers Wigan are promoted from League One after thrashing Blackpool 4-0 at Bloomfield Road. It’s straight back to Championship business for them. The Latics will be crowned champions if Burton fail to win today; victory for the Brewers over Gillingham would, more pressingly, put them on the edge of a first-ever season in the second tier. That can’t be confirmed until Monday, when Walsall play Fleetwood. That also spares Blackpool for today, while Doncaster need a win at rock-bottom Crewe. Chesterfield and Shrewsbury can seal survival with victories over Bury and Peterborough respectively. With Middlesbrough drawing at Birmingham last night, and both Burnley and Brighton playing on Monday, there’s only issue to address in today’s Championship games. Sheffield Wednesday host Cardiff, knowing that a draw will seal a play-off place. In League Two, Accrington and Oxford could both go up today with victories, providing that Bristol Rovers and Plymouth stumble. Oxford are looking to return to the third tier after 15 years away; Stanley last played at that level in 1960. Defeat for Plymouth at Cambridge could keep the play-off race alive, with the U’s battling Wimbledon for the final place. There’s more on all the possible ups and downs here. In La Liga, Real Madrid can return to the summit for a couple of hours with a win at Real Sociedad, who haven’t won in their three games since beating Barcelona. It’s a clash between two of Spain’s all-time big six: Real Madrid lead the way with 32 La Liga titles, their Basque opponents are sixth, with a whopping two. In Germany, Bayern are ready to make history; victory over Moenchengladbach would seal a first ever Bundesliga four-peat. Gladbach are in the race for fourth, and defeat will give Mainz and Schalke the chance to catch up, with current incumbents Hertha Berlin playing in-form Leverkusen later. At the bottom, Eintracht Frankfurt can boost their survival chances with a win at Darmstadt. In Ligue 1, Nice look set to miss out on ending a 56-year wait to return to the European elite; they’re 1-0 down at Nantes, chasing Lyon and Monaco for a top-three spot. At the Hawthorns, talented teenager Jonathan Leko makes his first Premier League start a week after his sixteenth birthday. He’s the first top-flight player born in 1999, which is a good enough reason for me: Bobby rolls those dice, with January signing Oumar Niasse starting ahead of Romelu Lukaku up front, and youngster Matthew Pennington in central defence. For Bournemouth, Callum Wilson starts for the first time since September.

It’s been a tough old season for the top flight’s established elite, and it could still end with Newcastle and Sunderland joining Aston Villa in dropping out. That would leave a top division without those three giants for the first time ever. Ever? Ever. Newcastle host Alan Pardew’s Crystal Palace (join Bryan Graham for that one), while Sunderland travel to summertime Stoke; the sort of fixtures one might hand pick in their situation, but on the flip side, games where defeat will leave either club with that sinking feeling. Another top-flight heavyweight could be about to end a record run; Everton haven’t sacked a manager since 2002, but unless Roberto Martínez can summon a fifth home win of the season against Bournemouth, it could be curtains. The reverse fixture, a 3-3 draw Everton refused to win, may go down as the Martínez Years’ defining moment. Another manager on the brink is Quique Sànchez Flores, reportedly set to be sacked by the ungrateful swines at Watford, with a first top-ten finish in 30 years still on the table. If they can’t beat Aston Villa at home today, his departure could be inevitable, and almost forgivable. There are no such worries for fellow newcomer Slaven Bilic, who still harbours dreams of leading West Ham to a first ever Champions League place. West Brom’s Tony Pulis will be looking forward to wrapping those dreams in a club shop scarf, and smashing them with a hammer. There’s history to be made in Europe, the Football League and beyond too. Plenty to enjoy without even mentioning Leicester. Ah. Sorry. Team news to follow.

      "Marouane Fellaini and Robert Huth banned for three matches over clash Marouane Fellaini and Robert Huth have accepted three-match bans after deciding not to contest their charges of violent conduct. The pair were charged by the Football Association after an off-the-ball incident during the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday, when the German defender pulled the Manchester United midfielder’s hair and Fellaini responded with an elbow to the face. The incident was not seen by match officials but was caught on video. Fellaini is still available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace because United, who are fifth in the table, have three league games left. Fellaini will miss the visits to Norwich and West Ham before the home game against Bournemouth on the last day of the season as United chase Champions League qualification. Huth’s team Leicester, who were crowned champions on Monday, play Everton and Chelsea. The United manager Louis van Gaal had earlier defended the Belgian midfielder by saying: “It’s not in the books that someone has to grab by the hair and then pull it behind – only in sex masochism. When I grab you by the hair, what are you doing? Shall I do it? It’s also a penalty. When I grab your hair, you react also. I know for sure.”\n",
      "Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham Oh what might have been. On an afternoon when Tynesiders devoted virtually the entire 90 minutes to imploring Rafa Benítez to stay on as Newcastle United’s manager next season his previously underachieving team belatedly remembered they could actually play a bit. In the process Aleksandar Mitrovic created one goal, scored another and was sent off for a truly appalling challenge as Tottenham Hotspur’s chances of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995 were shredded. Mauricio Pochettino’s players needed only a point to finish second but ended up third and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next season’s Champions League. Any Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next season’s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this? While Benítez’s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenham’s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race. At other times, on other days, St James’ Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the “Keep Rafa” agenda. It meant that, rather indulging in “sack the board” chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: “Rafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.” Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. “Rafa Benítez, Rafa Benítez,” fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead. Spurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia striker’s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchman’s 10th goal of a season he had started so brightly before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump. Fortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of “Stand up if you love the Toon,” before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a small aeroplane circling the skies above them trailing a large banner bearing the message: “Auf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.” It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense – there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of £1,000. As if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Lloris’s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksen’s fierce shot. As the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free Érik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net. If Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for England’s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko. This being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastle’s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissoko’s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksen’s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot. Buoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal. Turning creator, Aarons’s pass then picked out the overlapping Janmaat whose low shot defied Lloris. St James’ Park reverberated to a by now familiar theme. “We want you to stay,” they roared. “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Man of the match Gini Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)\n",
      "Arsène Wenger pleased Arsenal now have the experience to win ugly Plan B. For so many years, that concept was lobbed at Arsène Wenger come times of trouble in accusing tones. Plan B was the thing that Arsenal did not have and, on the occasions when their passing game did not click, when their creativity was squeezed, when their fluency dried up, Plan B taunted them by its very absence. In the last couple of matches Arsenal have needed something from the Plan B school. These were games three and four of the mini-series over Christmas and new year where tiredness, the lack of options to rotate because of injuries and a hint of knocked momentum inflicted by that 4-0 thumping at Southampton, meant Arsenal were not at their best. In both games the breakthrough came from a defender, whose determination to make a difference from a set piece paved the way for three precious points. After Gabriel powered in a header against Bournemouth Laurent Koscielny bounded into position to give Arsenal the edge over Newcastle. Wenger is not the type naturally to love a game that depends on dredging up reserves of effort. But his satisfaction was obvious at the end of a hard-fought victory because of everything it told him about the spirit of his team. “You fight, not to concede a goal, not panic and wait for your chance. We were more questioned on that aspect than the way we play football so it is good sometimes to win like that. Watching Newcastle I was impressed by them,” noted Wenger. “I think a team has always a charisma. If you look at the team as a unit, it is like a person. From the vibes coming out you can sense if there is something in there or not.” He feels there is more in there now than with the younger teams he had in recent years. “In my job if you don’t believe in your team you are in a bad shape,” he says. “I think they are more experienced now. When we moved into the stadium here, on the day we could play everybody off the park but, when you had to dig deep, come out with your knowledge and your experience, it was a bit more difficult.” With the exception of Héctor Bellerín (aged 20) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (22) the average age of the rest of Arsenal’s starting XI against Newcastle was 29. They needed plenty of collective knowhow to withstand some exciting moments from Newcastle, who broke with verve at times, before finding their decisive goal. There was promising movement and a cluster of chances were created when the attacking trio of Moussa Sissoko, Georginio Wijnaldum and Ayoze Pérez roaming behind Aleksandar Mitrovic got into their stride. Newcastle have to cling to the positive signs but at some stage soon they need to add a ruthless edge. Steve McClaren put on a brave face afterwards but it was not easy to take another harsh example of how performances do not always get rewarded in the hard currency of Premier League points. “We just have got to keep performing like that and keep believing, even though we keep getting knock-backs, especially in the last three games,” he said. “I cannot fault the players or their attitudes. The last three games we have lost 1-0 and had good chances to score first but we’ve not. That is why we have lost them. If we had had Olivier Giroud, I think we would have comfortably won the game. “That’s the difference in football and everybody is always searching for that. Papiss Cissé, who is a goalscorer, is out for the next two or three months. We have got other goalscorers – we have just got to step to the plate and start scoring. Doing our job.” Newcastle are actively searching for striking reinforcements in the winter transfer window. “We have been working behind the scenes. We will do tirelessly,” added McClaren. Rather like Wenger – albeit in rather different circumstances – McClaren is counting on the spirit he likes the look of to carry his team in the right direction.

      "Mark Noble counts his spot luck as West Ham see off bullish Burnley The demeanour was no less hangdog, but Slaven Bilic’s words were upbeat at last as he was able to celebrate a rare home Premier League victory. Mark Noble’s first-half goal, tucking away the rebound of his own saved penalty, earned West Ham three points in an unremarkable but unrelenting encounter with Burnley in which the home side dominated the first half only for the visitors to spring back in the second. “It’s a very important and a very hard-fought three points,” Bilic said after the match. “It was a very long game. I think we deserved it. There were two different halves. In the first it was all us, we hit the post twice and we had many shots. Not many clear-cut chances but we controlled the game. We had two penalty appeals, one was given, and I think we should have been two up.” His summary was spot on. West Ham recorded 72% possession in the first half but, even with Andy Carroll restored to the starting lineup, failed to open up a resolute Burnley backline. That was not necessarily a disaster for a team with West Ham’s skill set, however, so well stocked are they with long-range shooters, and both Pedro Obiang and Noble duly hit the woodwork from distance before half-time. The goal came in injury time in the first half and from a Dimitri Payet corner, after the Frenchman, who lasted the full 90 mintues, found Carroll with his cross. The forward’s header went straight towards Tom Heaton, but the Burnley keeper seemed to be impeded by Michail Antonio and could not get to the ball. Instead it bounced back into the path of Winston Reid and, unwilling to give him a shooting opportunity, Ben Mee pulled the New Zealander to the ground. The referee, Robert Madley, awarded the penalty and Noble turned it in at the second attempt after his first was well saved by Heaton. For Sean Dyche it was a goal that should never have been given. “It was a clear foul on Tom Heaton,” said the Burnley manager of Antonio’s block. “It’s very frustrating. Every other keeper goes on his back, flails around on the floor and it’s given. Because ours do it the proper way … now we’re called naive. You know, it used to be applauded when you played the game properly.” After a digression into the history of challenges on goalkeepers – “It’s not 1972 any more, not that I’m old enough to remember that” – Dyche went on to praise his side for their second-half improvement and declared himself disappointed not to be leaving with a point. “We had three big, big chances in the second half,” Dyche said. “Sam Vokes should have scored from a header, Andre Gray was an inch away from connecting in the six-yard box and Michael Keane had a chance from a set play. The clarity came back in the second half. We work hard, try to win every game and there’s been some good signs [in our away form].” Next up for Burnley are Spurs at White Hart Lane on Sunday. West Ham, meanwhile, welcome Hull City to the London Stadium and, after Wednesday night, the chance to secure back-to-back wins. But after speaking last week of his side’s need for a “clean sheet mentality”, Bilic believes his team must also shake off the mental “cramp” that afflicted them in the second half here. “I praised the players: the spirit, the mentality the clean sheet, all of that,” he said. “But I saw the cramp, the fear of winning. That cramp can only go away with climbing up the table but we managed it today and hopefully this should put us in a position that on Saturday we go in with less of that cramp and more confidence.”\n",
      "Manchester United 2-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened An eventually comfortable win for Manchester United, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring both goals – the first a thrilling, cavemanic header. Paul Pogba improved as the match progressed and showed his class with some penetrating runs and cocky passing. Southampton had more of the ball and should not be remotely discouraged by their performance, the thought of which will keep their fans warm for at least 10 minutes of their 47-journey home. Thanks for your company; goodnight. 90+3 min In the last minute of added time, Pogba spanks wide of the near post from 18 yards after fine play from Mkhitaryan. 89 min Still no sign of Marcus Rashford, as Chris Smalling comes on to replace Wayne Rooney. He put in a good cross for the first goal but was otherwise ineffective. 88 min Targett’s low cross is curled a few yards wide of the near post by Tadic. That, as Alan Smith says on Sky, sums up their night – they have played some really good football but have not been efficient in the final third. 86 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Your other reader may not know that Pogba’s brother Mathias plays for Partick Thistle in the SPFL. I saw him play at Tannadice the other week in the League Cup. He’s not worth 100 million euros, but could his brother cut it at a wet and windy Tannadice in front of 4000 fans on a Tuesday night?” 84 min Southampton make their final substitution, with Jay Rodriguez replacing an aggrieved Shane Long. 83 min The sliding Bailly does well to intercept Targett’s dangerous low cross. Southampton have shown an admirable refusal to accept they have lost this game. 82 min Ander Herrera replaces Anthony Martial, which suggests a switch to 4-3-3 and a shutting up of shop. 80 min “Do you know what were the pre-season odds for Ibrahimovic to finish top scorer, or to win the Player of the Year awards?” asks David Wall. “For someone with his record there seemed more talk of him as someone merely doing a valedictory tour than of him as someone perhaps a little past his prime but still a bonafide star, game-changing, season-shaping player. Now he’s taking penalties as well as being United’s main striker he’s sure to be in the running to lead the goal-scoring tables (barring injury, of course).” I don’t know the odds. But yes, for a team in transition it looks like an extremely smart short-term move. He’s 34 going on 29. The three behind him isn’t quite right yet, though. 79 min The game isn’t quite petering out - Southampton keep coming back for more - but there is a persuasive sense that it’s over as a contest. 77 min So what’s going on with Marcus Rashford then? If I were a United fan that would worry me a bit, because he is a glorious talent. 76 min Pogba marauds infield from the left and then curls well wide from just outside the box. 74 min Long flicks a near-post header just wide of the far post from Soares’s cross, and then Mata is replaced by Henrikh Mkhitaryan. 73 min If it goes to 2-1 then Mourinho might take Pogba off but there’s no need at the moment, especially as he’s having his best period of the match with the ball. Tonight is all about Pogba and Ibrahimovic but Valencia has been a revelation going forward, close to his 2009-12 best. 69 min Pogba, who is starting to boss the game, gives it to Valencia on the right. He skins Targett and stands up a deep cross to Ibrahimovic, who rises imperiously and then completely mistimes a looping header back across goal. Rooney was flagged offside but it wasn’t going in anyway. 67 min “Rob,” says Mark Tuite, “who is this Tasic you keep banging on about?” No idea. You’re welcome! 66 min United are playing some great stuff now. Pogba ignores the cries of “shooooot” and gives it wide to Ibrahimovic. He plays a deliberate chip all the way across the area to Martial, who dummies Soares by pulling it down on his chest but then seems to forget to shoot and is tackled by the recovering Soares. Moments later, Davis is replaced by Charlie Austin for Southampton. 65 min Martial scorches past Fonte and into the area, where his shot is outstandingly blocked by Van Dijk. The ball rebounds to Rooney, who chips it pitifully out of play. Moments later, Martial finds the underlapping Shaw in the area and his cutback is cleared. That was a great run from Shaw. 63 min Pogba beats Clasie beautifully without touching the ball to start a move that leads to a corner on the right. It’s curled in and headed over from six yards by Pogba, under pressure from a defender. 61 min A mistake from Zlatan allows Southampton to break. Van Dijk’s sot is blocked by Bailly and then Clasie splashes the follow-up miles wide from 20 yards. Southampton have done lots of things very well tonight; United have just been more efficient. 58 min Southampton continue to push forward. A cross from the right is flicked towards Redmond, who can’t quite get it out of his feet and eventually shoots wide under pressure from Mata. That was a decent opportunity. In an unrelated development, it turns out the Tadic goal was disallowed, rightly, for offside. 55 min Pogba’s confidence is one of his greatest strengths. He’ll take the ball in any situation, no matter how tight or dangerous. There are still doubts as to whether he’s a better central-midfield option than Rafael and Ji-sung Park but he is a fascinating talent. Zlatan makes it four goals in three games with a good penalty, sidefooting into the bottom-left corner before roaring to the crowd while flexing his muscles. He is a preposterous and magnificent man. A daft trip by Clasie on Shaw, who was going nowhere. It’s a clear penalty. 50 min Martial comes infield from the left and hits a dangerous low shot that bounces just in front of Forster. He does well to palm it away and it’s lumped clear by a defender. 49 min Tasic has a goal disallowed for a foul on Bailly. His lack of complaint suggests it was fair enough, though we haven’t seen a replay. It was a smart flicked header but I think he shoved Bailly out of the way. 48 min “In Pogba it looks to me like Mourinho has finally got his hands on the Gerrard type player he’s wanted since he came to the Premier League,” says Phil Martin. “It’ll be interesting to see what he does with him, does he coach out the risks, or build his team around covering for them?” He’ll change him a bit but Pogba’s main weakness is decision-making and that should improve naturally. I can’t see Mourinho going the full Joe Cole, certainly. I’d imagine he’ll eventually play 4-3-3 and let Pogba run free. 47 min An intrepid run from the impressive Shaw takes him to the edge of the area before he is tackled. The ball runs to Mata, who wallops it into orbit from range. 46 min Southampton begin the second half, trailing to a moment of Zlatanic magic in a first half that they dominated. Kipling latest “‘If you can concede to a ridiculous header from a certifiable genius, And still knock it about prettily in the middle of the park, You’ll be a man, my son,’” says Matt Dony of my 42nd-minute entry. “Of course, the implication being that ‘manhood’ is something to aspire to and inherently better than those weak women. Typical media sexism. You’ll be blaming the immigrants, next.” Nigel Farage is my Rushmore, what of it? Half-time reading United lead, slightly against the run of play, through a fierce header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Paul Pogba has been brave and progressive in possession, though not always successfully. Southampton have had more of the ball and are certainly in this. See you in 10 minutes! 44 min Davis, who has probably had more of the ball than any midfielder on either side, drills over the top from 25 yards. 43 min Pogba thrills the crowd with a fine run straight down the centre of the pitch before playing the ball to Martial. His cross is disappointing, just as he has been so far. His unhappy Euro 2016 might have affected his confidence. 42 min Southampton have reacted to the goal in a manner that would please Kipling, resuming their confident possession football. They have been the better team, although let the record show that United seem happy enough playing on the counter-attack. 41 min “All the attributes of an English No9 allied to the nonchalant sills of a Balkan No10,” says Adam Hirst. “Wish he’d arrived six years ago.” What, about of Bebe? No thanks. 39 min “Judging purely from the Man Utd teamsheet, they don’t appear to have a midfield of any description,” says Ian Copestake. “Unless you count Fellaini as a midfield target man.” United take the lead against the run of play with a belting header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Valencia found Rooney on the right, and he did well to keep the ball in play. Then he curled a high, outswinging cross towards the far post, where Ibrahimovic beasted above Fonte and thumped a downward header into the net from 10 yards. 34 min A well-struck low shot from Rooney, 25 yards from goal, is comfortably saved by Forster. 32 min A chance for Southampton. Tadic sweeps an excellently early ball into the space behind Bailly to find Long in an inside-left position just outside the box. With Bailly making up the ground, Long hits a feeble low shot straight at De Gea. That was the best chance so far. 30 min Mata’s volleyed pass somehow finds its way to Ibrahimovic, whose cross from the right towards Rooney takes an important deflection off the sliding Van Dijk and goes behind for a corner. 29 min A Hollywood move from United: Pogba’s dink, Mata’s header across the box and Zlatan’s flying volley over the bar. It was a quarter-chance at best. 28 min Pass count: Man Utd 94-160 Southampton. United don’t really mind playing on the counter-attack, though having pace up front would help. Rooney is, sad to say, peripheral at best and embarrassing at worst. 26 min Davis’s flat, fast free-kick finds Van Dijk, whose volley is well blocked by Valencia. The ball comes to Long, who rattles it just wide of the near post. There were cheers from some of the Southampton fans, who thought it was in; a fleeting moment of joy before the reality of a 47-hour trip home with nothing but a bottle of warm Volvic to sustain them hit home once again. 25 min At the moment United look like a collection of players rather than a team. It’s a cliché but it’s true. The sooner they get Rashford in the side, for Mata, Rooney or even Martial, the better they will be. Southampton have a serious chance of winning this game. 23 min “Thanks for the MBM, it is the only way I have to follow the game while waiting for my flight in Ougadougou airport,” writes Danny Kelly. “Do you think Ferguson secretly hopes that Pogba will be a failure thus vindicating his, now infamous, decision not to offer him a better contract and keep him at the club?” I thought the issue was playing time rather than the quality of his contract? Either way, I doubt Ferguson cares, at least not in terms of professional vindication. It might be different on a personal level. He can’t be happy about Pogba or Mourinho being at the club. 22 min Valencia has been United’s best attacker so far. Pogba has been up and down but with his usual willingness to take the risky option whenever possible. Rooney and Zlatan have been anonymous. 19 min Redmond spins neatly behind Bailly and into the area on the right. Tadic is free at the far post, a few yards from goal, but Redmond just overhits the cross. Southampton are, at the moment, playing like the home side. 18 min I certainly wouldn’t rule out a third consecutive Southampton win at Old Trafford. They have started this game very impressively, especially when you consider they were supposed to roll over. 17 min “Poor Rob,” says Ian Copestake. “I bet you would like to wet your whistle this footballing Friday night. Have Sky attached some epithet to this day of days? Super is obviously not applicable or alliterative enough, but it must be an f-word of sorts.” Aren’t they just calling it FNF? Or, if you’re a Southampton fan who has to get home tonight, FFS. 15 min A cross from the left eventually bounces to Tadic, who volleys into orbit from a tight angle. This is a pretty open game. But then this is not a typical Jose Mourinho side; they are pretty top heavy. 13 min Ibrahimovic on the left eases the ball back to Pogba, who opens his body smartly just inside the box. and hits a decent shot that is patted down by Forster. 13 min “Hi,” says John. “Pogba’s headphones are P7 not P5.” Typical embarrassing Grauniad error. Somebody deserves a P45 for that, and I’m not talking about headphones. 12 min Romeu is indeed replaced by Jordi Clasie. Mata’s corner is headed clear by Shane Long. 11 min Valencia combines well with Mata, whose return pass is put behind for a corner by Davis. Romeu is down again, and might need to be replaced before the corner is taken. 10 min “‘If two teams play a game of football and the media couldn’t give a flying toss about the smaller team, do they actually exist?’,” begins Tamara Hampton, quoting an earlier entry. “So does that make Southampton #SchrödingersTeam?” In modern football, Schrödinger has a lot of teams. 9 min There’s a break in play while Romeu receives treatment. He’s fine. 7 min Southampton’s passing has been confident and assured in the early stages. It’s been a bright, breezy start to the game. 5 min Valencia, who has staked an early claim to be the surprise success of Mourinho’s first season, wins a corner with the kind of no-frills run he used to attempt all the time in the Ferguson years. Nowt comes from it but that was more promising for United. 4 min After a long spell of Southampton possession, United get to touch the ball. Pogba tries a cute pass to Ibrahimovic that is well cut out by Soares. 1 min Peep peep! United kick off from right to left. Pogba gives the ball away immediately and Southampton break dangerously to win a free-kick right on the edge of the box. It’s a fair way to the left of centre but well within shooting range. Tadic blasts it straight into the wall. “Who is the ref?” asks Peter Nelson, politely highlight the inadequacy of my work thus far. It is Anthony Taylor, and he’s about to moisten his whistle. “I don’t have any answers to the questions in your Preamble but the Bowers & Wilkins P5 headphones Pogba is wearing are really great,” says Petter Settli, chief executive of Bowers & Wilkins . They are Pre-match reading Wouldn’t bother with the article but some of the comments are well banter. Here’s our man Ryan Dunne “Is it wrong to wonder where Fellaini-Pogba ranks on the most mismatched midfield pairings, talent-wise?” I can’t believe you’re writing Pogba off already. Honk! Ho-honk! Honk? Actually I think Roy Keane and Michael Appleton played together against Swindon in 1996, which is a bit of a mismatch. “Sky’s new show pretty much redefining the term ‘one-eyed’,” says Gary Naylor. “I don’t often find fault with Sky’s sports coverage, but this is ridiculous. There are two teams playing tonight.” Ah, but you know what the philosophers say: if two teams play a game of football and the media couldn’t give a flying toss about the smaller team, do they actually exist? Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Valencia, Bailly, Blind, Shaw; Fellaini, Pogba; Mata, Rooney, Martial; Ibrahimovic. Substitutes: Romero, Smalling, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Young, Mkhitaryan, Rashford. Southampton (4-D-2) Forster; Soares, Fonte, Van Dijk, Targett; Romeu; Hojbjerg, Davis; Tadic; Long, Redmond. Substitutes: McCarthy, Yoshida, Clasie, Rodriguez, Austin, Ward-Prowse, Pied. Hello. In the last few years Old Trafford has doubled up as a public nap station, but nobody will be getting 40 winks tonight. Manchester United host Southampton in a match that is full of talking points before a ball has been miskicked. Will Paul Pogba start on his return to Old Trafford? Where is Stormzy watching the game? How will Zlatan fare on his home debut? Will Jose Mourinho be able to maintain as his poker face as he finally, finally lives his dream of walking down the Old Trafford touchline as Manchester United manager? Will he continue to ignore the otherworldly talent of Marcus Rashford so that he can postpone an awkward conversation with Wayne Rooney? Will anyone acknowledge the existence of Southampton, let alone point out that they have won here in the past two seasons? Will Southampton’s fans make it home for Sunday lunch? Is the introduction of Friday Night Football a deliberate attempt to sabotage the viewing ratings of Nightmare Tenants, Slum Landlords on Channel 5? And what did happen to Arthur Graham? Kick off at 8pm BST. Rob will be with you shortly. In the meantime, why not have a read of Sachin Nakrani on Friday night football and GIL! SCOTT! HERON!\n",
      "Shapeshifter Antonio Conte stamps his dynamic personality on Chelsea For Chelsea fans, or indeed anyone with an interest in the high-rev methods of Antonio Conte, there was a slightly alarming moment as the Premier League international break arrived at the start of October. Conte announced he would be going to Italy to rest. He was already exhausted. OK, then. Just the 31 league games, two domestic cups, one transfer window and 10-15 miles of febrile touchline sprints left to go this season. What could possibly go wrong from here? It is understandable Conte should have arrived in west London less than refreshed given his summer at Euro 2016, the burdens of starting a major job and his own full-body absorption in the process: the hair-tearing grief at every setback, the tendency to celebrate each high with uncontained, eye-popping joy, haring about like a man who has just struck oil beneath his patio decking or made the first ever recorded discovery of chocolate ice cream. In reality Conte is simply a manager who works best coiled tight and always on the edge. In this respect he looks a pretty good fit for a Premier League season where top spot has changed hands nine times and where the ability to cajole a cohesive whole out of a new-ish group of players while simultaneously sliding down the banisters and performing complex calculus on an abacus is likely to decide the destiny of an open title race. With just under a third of the season gone four points separate the top five teams, all of whom have a reasonable chance of going on to win it. Beyond this the league is unusually interesting in a tactical sense, with a shared attempt at the top to marry technical players and positional fluidity with a full-throttle physicality that feels quite English in its unquestioning intensity. As Conte nipped off for a lie-down at the start of October there was a view in these pages that any team finishing ahead of Liverpool at the end of the season would do so “bloodied and blistered and breathless”. Six weeks on the latest club to take up the slack at the front of the peloton are Chelsea, to whom the same reasoning might now be applied. Chelsea’s current run of six league wins without conceding a goal has its roots in Conte’s bold shift of shape in September. The early attempts at a 4-2-4 had already begun to elide into a 4-3-3. Defeat by Arsenal brought some soul-searching and a more profound change to 3-4-3, with Cesc Fàbregas discarded and the roles of three key players clarified with thrilling results. At which point, enter David Luiz, defensive giant. Yes, that David Luiz, a player who has had a peculiar double-life, damned by his own relentlessly trumpeted mistakes and at the same time rewarded with ever more extravagant playing contracts. During the last World Cup in Brazil there was an airline advert that featured a zanily grinning David Luiz in full pilot’s outfit proudly inviting you to board his waiting jet, arguably the least reassuring passenger safety message ever devised. And yet he has been key to Chelsea’s recent stability, not just as a deep playmaker at the heart of that three but as the aggressive, spirited defensive leader he has always been in between the odd horrific performance. Aged 29 now, the only major club football medal to escape the world’s most expensive defender across European three countries is - so far - a Premier League title medal. Which is fairly steady going for a man routinely dismissed as a flake and a saboteur. Further upfield Eden Hazard has been liberated by the 3-4-3, allowed to operate in forward gear by a manager who has accepted his lack of cover rather than simply fuming at it like a disappointed stepdad. In 12 league games Hazard has made 52 successful dribbles, compared with 89 the whole of last season. He should pass his total of 36 shots in the whole of 2015-16 against Tottenham on Saturday. Against that Hazard has made just four tackles. But Chelsea are top, and their best player has rediscovered his lateral spring, the ability to take the ball and turn in a single movement. Victor Moses, high-class wing-back, has been the most obvious gain. Moses is also the epitome of a common trait among the insurgent Conte-Klopp-Guardiola managerial type, the ability to make good use of the things that they find, recycling some talented but dormant part into a key component. Like James Milner’s fine turn at left-back, or Guardiola’s tweaking of key creative midfielders, Moses has been Conte’s own Womble-player, an itinerant winger and No10 across five English clubs before the age of 25 but now in the best period of his career as a powerful and utterly committed right wing-back. The sudden surge of eviscerating form, sparked by a decisive switch of shape, is nothing new in a Conte team. There are parallels with his first season at Juventus in 2011-12, where 14 of his first 27 Serie A matches were drawn but Juve ended up winning the title unbeaten in the league. Conte had been desperate to fit the thrillingly energetic Arturo Vidal into his team. In late September Vidal finally made the starting XI, Juve ran through Milan in Turin, a new 4-3-3 shape was up and running and Conte was on his way to a hat-trick of titles. As with Juve that year the lack of European football looks a significant advantage for Chelsea. There is an idea that the major plus here is to do with fatigue or injury, but managers talk instead of simply having those extra two days to plan and drill their players. Such is the way of the modern coach. In contract with the old Alex Ferguson-era idea of momentum, winning teams rolling on with the same system, combinations ever-more grooved under pressure, it is the interventionist, hands-in-the-cake-mix tendencies of the modern breed that stand out. Conte is obsessed with the fitness and physicality of his players, talking constantly with his medical staff, brooding over sprockets and hinges like an F1 pit boss, shifting his team on reports of twinges and twangs. Similarly the hands-on nature of Jurgen Klopp’s coaching has been noted, the tendency to physically haul players around the training pitch, something Ron Greenwood could be seen doing at West Ham in the 1970s. Klopp’s Liverpool experienced their first little gulp this weekend, as Southampton set out to defend against a slightly depleted team. Like a batsman who comes out and hits a flurry of fours, then has to change gear as the field drops back, Klopp will now look to adjust, to pick up the ones and twos, to hold Liverpool’s attacking fire for the right moment. No doubt the same process of reeling in and counter-adjustment will hit Chelsea in the coming weeks as opposition managers find a way to get behind the wing-backs or to harry David Luiz as Middlesbrough did on Sunday. Chelsea’s next two opponents are Tottenham and Manchester City. This evolving team may find life less comfortable against similar high-intensity machines, fellow hard-pressers. But a year on from the last days of José they can at least be sure they will not fail for want of sheer, thrilling focus.\n",
      "Victor Moses goal seals Chelsea comeback as Tottenham lose unbeaten record The team who are already developing an air of Antonio Conte’s Undroppables cruise on. After fielding the same Premier League selection for the sixth successive – and successful – time, Chelsea continued their revival as they saw off Tottenham, showing the mettle to muster a comeback after going a goal behind in the first half. Two of the players who have thrived most from the Conte redesign, Pedro and Victor Moses, supplied the goals to settle a riveting local tussle. After Manchester City and Liverpool had plundered points earlier in the day, nothing less than three would suffice to return to the top of the table. Chelsea reacted ruthlessly. It left Conte with the air of a contented manager. He acknowledged the evolution that makes his team a different proposition in the high-intensity games to the side who capitulated against Liverpool and Arsenal. “Now we are another team compared to the Liverpool and Arsenal games,” he said. “If we were the same team we would lose this game, for sure. Now we have another type of confidence. I liked our reaction a lot. We won and I am pleased because it wasn’t easy.” For Tottenham, defeat here to a long-term bogey side is nothing new but what must hurt is that for a spell their performance showed them at their best, with a refreshed appetite for the style that had them unbeaten in the Premier League until the winter chill had set in. History suggested that Stamford Bridge might be a test too far and what felt like a week of reckoning duly delivered two heavyweight blows. After tumbling out of the Champions League in midweek, Mauricio Pochettino’s men were punctured in the league. The Tottenham manager managed to be frustrated and philosophical at the same time: “If you want to analyse the result, Chelsea win, congratulations. If you want to analyse the 94 minutes, Tottenham had a lot of positives. But in football you need to score. In football sometimes it’s difficult to explain but this is not difficult. They were clinical in front of the goal and we weren’t.” After the smouldering volcano of this fixture last season, he had called upon his team to be “brave” and his players began as if that instruction was still ringing in their ears. Keeping a semblance of self-control was imperative and they started by exerting important authority in midfield, pegging Chelsea back and keeping confident possession. Ten minutes in they soared in front. Mousa Dembélé worked the ball up the left and it was moved via Dele Alli to Christian Eriksen. The Dane saw a chink of goal to aim at. His thunderous shot was laced with curl and flew into the net. It was the first time Chelsea’s defence had been beaten in 600 minutes. Conte looked exasperated as his team could not get a foothold. The muscle in Tottenham’s midriff, with Dembélé and Victor Wanyama patrolling in front of Eric Dier and Jan Vertonghen, proved a meaty barrier. David Luiz mustered Chelsea’s first shot just before the half-hour mark, a whack of a free-kick that Hugo Lloris caught comfortably. Tottenham’s dominance was such that they continued to create strong chances. After efforts from Kyle Walker, Harry Kane and Eriksen the visitors wondered how they were not even further in front as half-time approached. What more devastating time for Chelsea to summon some inspiration. A minute before half-time all Tottenham’s hard work was speared by a moment of glorious individual skill. Pedro picked up possession 20 yards out and wrong-footed the Tottenham defence with a touch that had a dash of Cruyff turn about it. The Spaniard bent his shot into the top corner with a flourish. Off the hook after a pretty uncomfortable first 44 minutes, Conte delivered some choice words at half-time. Chelsea came out with enhanced determination and were soon ahead. They pressed the ball off Tottenham and broke with intent. Eden Hazard invited Diego Costa to drive forwards and he capped a bullish and clever run with a killer pass to Moses, whose shot squirted off Lloris and Vertonghen on the way in. The pendulum had swung. Chelsea’s energy levels suddenly made Tottenham look ponderous. It spoke volumes about how the balance of the game shifted that both Chelsea’s wing-backs had so much more room to get involved. Although Tottenham tried to manufacture a comeback of their own, Chelsea’s second-half solidity was a far tougher nut to crack. Conte’s Undroppables cherished their win. Tottenham’s pain was palpable. Conte tried hard to deflect any title talk at this stage. “It is not right to talk about this,” he said. “We have a long way in front of us. It’s important to stay humble and continue to trust in our work. Today we won a game against a really strong team. Tomorrow it’s important to think about the next game, against City, another very strong team. We have to continue to work. We don’t forget that against Arsenal and Liverpool we lost.” In attitude and application, Conte’s Chelsea are a force to be reckoned with.\n",
      "West Ham stun 10-man Everton as Dimitri Payet seals fightback win Season tickets at Goodison Park come with a guarantee of entertainment and the promise of frustration. Those at the Olympic Stadium may come with the carrot of Champions League football. Everton announced on Friday that they are reducing prices for next season. West Ham United are raising expectations for it. An extraordinary comeback, featuring three goals in 12 minutes, turned defeat into victory and maintained their hopes of a top-four finish. Credibility was stretched as the points were pilfered. “Unbelievable,” said Slaven Bilic. “Nobody can deny we deserved it. We showed our quality, we showed our stubbornness and we got a great win.” They are a team transformed. They used to approach trips to Merseyside with trepidation, but won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years in August. A 16-game winless run against Everton in the top flight came to an abrupt end, courtesy of Michail Antonio, Diafra Sakho and Dimitri Payet. West Ham’s signing of the season provided the dramatic denouement. Andy Carroll headed Aaron Cresswell’s diagonal ball down, Sakho improvised a backheel flick and Payet nipped in to score the winner. A catalytic signing contributed a crucial goal to determine a cracking game. Yet another Hammer exerted an equal influence and made the fightback feasible. West Ham were two goals adrift and being run ragged by Romelu Lukaku when twin pieces of acrobatics by Adrián proved to be turning points. The Spaniard saved twice from Everton’s top scorer, once from a strangely hesitant penalty and once when he burst clear on goal. He had already made stunning stops to deny James McCarthy and Ross Barkley, who each eyed spectacular long-range strikes, in a one-man rearguard action. It brought a belated reward when his attacking colleagues conjured three goals. “If they had scored that penalty they would have won the game maybe 3-0 or 4-0,” Bilic admitted. Everton could rue Adrián’s excellence and Lukaku’s misses. Yet, profligate as he was, he has also proved prolific. In any case, there were other reasons for Everton’s seventh home league defeat of the season. They display a costly carelessness, and have squandered a two-goal advantage four times already. A poor, porous defence has been a regular source of complaint and Ramiro Funes Mori stood flat-footed for two of the West Ham goals. Roberto Martínez’s initial gambit of matching Bilic’s 3-4-3 formation had paid off and his half-time introduction of Muhamed Besic brought a benefit when the Bosnian won the penalty that Lukaku spurned. Yet the removal of two in-form goalscorers who were tormenting West Ham – first Aaron Lennon and then Lukaku – afforded the visitors the initiative. And the culpable Belgian really was Kevin Mirallas, not Lukaku. The winger had been booked for diving before he upended Cresswell. His arm was immediately raised in apology but it was not enough to spare him a second yellow card, or Everton an hour with 10 men. The Goodison faithful afforded the departing winger a generous ovation and blamed the referee, Anthony Taylor. So did Martínez, who identified a scapegoat for a setback. “The second booking is a decision the referee has to make,” he admitted. “The first one is a ridiculous decision. Why should we book a player because we feel it is not a free-kick? I don’t feel he is a referee who understands the game in a way that we want it played.” Everton’s understanding was apparent in a slickly worked opener, Bryan Oviedo finding Lukaku, who accelerated away to score in an eighth successive game against West Ham. “The performance for spells was outstanding,” said Martínez. So was Lukaku’s. Bilic admitted: “When they had the ball, he makes that one-player loss less visible. He creates mayhem.” He also fashioned Lennon’s fifth goal in seven games, the winger accepting Lukaku’s return pass to score. Then Adrián intervened. “The penalty was a big blow psychologically,” said Martínez. “Romelu Lukaku is such a reliable footballer that we were all a little bit shocked.” West Ham were galvanised. Bilic had gambled, bringing on Carroll and Sakho. Substitutes starred after a starter scored. Antonio’s third goal in three games was headed in from Mark Noble’s cross. Another delivery from the visitors’ left flank yielded an equaliser. Payet was the supplier, Sakho heading in. Payet’s winner left even Bilic bemused. “I didn’t know what to do, so I ran down the tunnel and I came back straightaway,” he said, though a celebration was the product of a half-time conversation. “I said that ‘we are one down but we are going to do it’,” he revealed. “We had to be less sexy and more lethal.” Everton could do with displaying a similar hard-nosed pragmatism. “I thought our performance, defensively, was outstanding for 78 minutes and very poor from then on,” said Martínez. But whether discounting tickets or gifting goals, their generosity knows no bounds.\n",
      "Tottenham win title for youthful promise and being the most watchable If you’ve somehow managed to miss the opening eight months of the Premier League season you could have picked up a pretty decent precis of the action so far just by watching Sunday’s games at the Stadium of Light and White Hart Lane. Basically it’s been like that all along. Leicester City have scored lots of breakaway goals and played like a proper team. It’s been emotional. People have cried. The usual heavyweights have ranged from poor to bafflingly dreadful. And beyond that Tottenham Hotspur have been the most watchable, most promising, most intriguing team in the league this season. All issues of sentiment, underdoggery and fairytale glee aside, it is an achievement that deserves at least a slice of the adulation being lavished on the champions-elect. This is not to suggest Leicester are unworthy league winners. The table is never wrong. Leicester have been the most consistent team by some way, seven points clear and not so much sprinting for the line as already off on one of those helmet-doffing, high-fiving home-run trundles around the baseball diamond, waving to the crowd, taking the cheers, ball safely spiralling off above the bleachers into the blue. Even in the second half of the season Leicester have dropped fewer points than their nearest challengers. They beat Spurs 1-0 at White Hart Lane in January, and deservedly so. For Claudio Ranieri’s team this has been both a wonderful story and a purely sporting triumph of teamwork, talent and unblinking focus. Still, one achievement should not diminish another and Spurs have been by so many other measures the most compelling team in the Premier League, the most layered, all the while remaining the only Premier League team (fairytale Foxes included) to run a profit on transfer spending over the past five years. Against Manchester United on Sunday they started poorly. Dele Alli made a lovely run for his goal but otherwise he was largely absent. Harry Kane ragged Chris Smalling about once or twice but touched the ball only 33 times, a rare lack of involvement for an unusually assertive No9. The full-backs were muted, Kyle Walker bothered at times by the high-class menace of Anthony Martial. And yet even on an off-day Tottenham were hugely enthralling in the periods when the pistons began to fire. By the time the goal rush arrived in the final 20 minutes Mauricio Pochettino’s team had begun to swarm in that familiar way, every passing angle, every pocket of space choked off. This isn’t so much the old push-and-run Spurs as push-and-run-and-snipe-and-hustle, albeit in a controlled kind of way. The idea Tottenham will inevitably tire themselves out before the season’s end has always been based on a slight misunderstanding. This isn’t simply covering every blade of grass, Carlton Palmer-style. There is no blur of perpetual motion here. Spurs’ defensive movements are instead minutely drilled, with every shift of position among the opposition a cue for some interlocking reshuffle of the pieces, energy not so much wasted as put to synchronised good use. Often Eric Dier and Mousa Dembélé will stand still, waiting for the play to arrange itself around them. There are some interesting similarities between the league’s top two. Both have a simple set of methods based around teamwork and quick, accurate passing. Both are genuine collectives, the role of each player equally weighted, without favourites or luxuries or glitzy passengers. But Spurs simply have more depth to their game. They are a team who can score all kinds of goals, can play with the ball or on the break, for whom eight players have scored three or more goals in the league this season. Spurs have scored more goals than anyone else while conceding fewer. Their starting outfield players were, on average, almost four years younger than Leicester’s equivalent on Sunday. Ranieri’s men will be hugely impressive champions but there is another gear to come in this Tottenham team. Or at least, there should be. If there is reason to celebrate Spurs excellence, even as the season dwindles into a race for second place, it is the simple fact that such progress is precarious. Last weekend Sir Alex Ferguson gave an interview to Sky Sports, apparently at his own behest, in which he lavished praise on Pochettino’s work. It is hard to see any obvious reason, beyond the really obvious, why Ferguson would choose to do this. Pochettino is an ambitious manager. He will be hugely in demand now, as will Tottenham’s best players. There is a shelf life to any rising team these days. Money will not allow this to go on unchecked for ever. Not that there is reason to think anyone’s leaving just yet. This Spurs team can look forward to another title challenge next season, with plenty of flux among the usual heavyweights and the new champions facing a different set of challenges, not least the demands of running a midweek team as well. Spurs dropped seven points this season after Europa League fixtures, the exact extent of Leicester’s lead at the top. By the end against United, Tottenham were lolling about at White Hart Lane like drunken lords, no doubt thrilled by the sense of their own power in that three-goal burst but still aware that for this season the race may be done. For the most captivating of second-placers the challenge now is simply to make their excellence count in more tangible ways.\n",
      "Premier League relegation battlers brace themselves for a telling weekend This might not be the end of the football season, yet as the old saying goes when the fourth round of the FA Cup heaves into view and the days begin to lengthen, you can see the end of the season from here. The good news for Newcastle, Sunderland and Aston Villa is that all three clubs have shown a slight upturn in form and fortune, in some cases very slight, over the past few weeks. The bad news, obviously, is that these grand old clubs still form the Premier League’s bottom three in mid-January. Actually it is worse than that. Mid-January has already gone, and after this weekend’s fixtures January will have gone. The Premier League takes a break for the FA Cup next week, so it will be February before we know it. The better news for the three clubs in trouble, or at least the less bad news, is that this weekend’s games are all winnable. Yes, I know that is a ridiculous thing to say. All games are theoretically winnable, though it may be truer of this season that all games are actually losable, and if our doughty trio had managed to win some of their previous winnable games they would be higher in the table than they are at the moment. Yet even so, Sunderland are at home to Bournemouth, Newcastle away at Watford, while Villa have the small matter of a Midlands derby at The Hawthorns. At the start of the season, had anyone told the bottom three they were going to need points in a hurry to end January on a positive note, they would not have been too frightened by the fixtures just detailed. Villa arguably have the most arduous task, what with being adrift at the bottom and away from home, but anything can happen in a local derby. The two north-east clubs play newly promoted sides, and if you cannot take points in extremis from such games you probably deserve to be down among the relegation candidates. The flaw in that theory is not difficult to spot. It is no longer the start of the season. After new year you are not really a newly promoted side any more, you are a Premier League team with more than half of your fixtures completed. And for most of the season Watford and Bournemouth have not been playing like newly promoted sides with scant experience of the top flight; they have been playing with confidence and no little application, picking up points against bigger opponents with some notable results. But, and here is the big question, where has it got them? Undoubtedly Watford and Bournemouth have been among the surprise successes of a generally surprising season but late January finds all three promoted sides in the bottom half of the table, with Bournemouth and Norwich (at home to Liverpool on Saturday since you ask, probably thankful that Luis Suárez will not be around) looking particularly vulnerable to recoveries by the bigger clubs beneath them. Watford do not look in too much trouble. They are on the same points as Everton and even Roberto Martínez’s biggest critics have not mentioned relegation yet, though they have lost four straight league games since taking a point from Stamford Bridge on Boxing Day and it could be that top-flight fatigue, sometimes known as reality, is beginning to set in. Saturday may offer some pointers as to how the rest of the season plays out. Bournemouth gave themselves a lift with a convincing win over Norwich at the weekend, though they are still only three points above the drop zone. Should they lose at the Stadium of Light, and Sam Allardyce has probably had the fixture circled on his calendar for some time, Newcastle could close the gap with a win at Watford. There seems no obvious reason why Newcastle should win at Watford, except Steve McClaren’s side finally seem to be improving while Quique Sánchez Flores needs to prove his players have not hit a wall. With Swansea at Everton on Sunday, where the home side really need to release the handbrake to prevent their manager’s claims of a European finish looking silly – for a team playing so well Everton have been stuck in 11th for far too long – this could be the weekend for a few incremental yet important shifts in league position. Although nothing is ever decided in January, not even late January, February can turn into a long month for teams heading downwards in the table. Those that can see a glimmer of hope, on the other hand, especially ones already out of the FA Cup, can start counting out the games to the end of the season and working out exactly what they have to do. So to cut to the chase, before the last league games in January, it looks as if the two north-east clubs have a chance of escaping their present predicament, while Bournemouth, Norwich and Swansea are in danger of getting sucked down. One would imagine the three teams eventually relegated will come from the current bottom six. Chelsea are still theoretically in trouble, only one point ahead of Bournemouth, but no one seriously expects the Stamford Bridge crisis to get that much worse now. They dropped a couple of points at home at the weekend but Everton are a good side, and Chelsea probably regarded it as a point saved, if not stolen. West Bromwich are not as high in the table as they would like but appear capable of getting over the line in the 16 games that remain, as do Watford, assuming their slump does not continue for long enough to cause panic. Clearly this is all guesswork until a few more games have been played; it just happens that one or two fairly crucial matches are coming up this weekend. Not least the one at West Bromwich. The last rites were read over Villa’s survival chances some weeks ago but the situation is not yet hopeless. On the final weekend in January last year Leicester were bottom of the table with 17 points, and look what has happened to them since. Villa are bottom with 12, with only two wins to their name, and although that does appear desperate, a win against local rivals on Saturday would take them to 15 and possibly signal a change in outlook. Villa do not appear to have Leicester’s squad strength, it must be said, but if they are going to do anything other than meekly accept their fate they need to start now. Although no prizes are ever handed out in January, there is no better time to start a recovery. After February, or to be more exact after the first week of March, the remaining games start to be expressed in single figures. Unless you happen to be Leicester, that is when teams near the bottom of the table usually find the season slipping away.\n",
      "Manchester City will not give up title fight, says Manuel Pellegrini Manuel Pellegrini insists that Manchester City will not give up their Premier League title challenge despite Wednesday’s 3-0 defeat at Liverpool leaving the club 10 points behind Leicester City. The loss at Anfield was a third consecutive league reverse for City, Pellegrini’s side last claiming three points four weeks ago when Sunderland were beaten. Yet City have 11 games remaining – including a match in hand – and with bottom-place Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday the manager believes they can still claim the championship. “Remember the first season I was here, we needed to win the three games in hand and we won the three games,” he said. “Everyone said we were out of it but we won the games and won the title. This group of players will never give up while we have the option to do it. We have one game in hand but it’s more important not to think about that but just to improve our Premier League performance. “We are not going to give up – it’s a lot of points to the leaders. You never know when you are going to lose points. We must continue as far as we can and add the most amount of points we can, then we can see where we end up. We try to win every time we play – we just had a bad moment but we have another 33 points to try and arrange it.” City have 47 points and are separated from fifth-placed Manchester United only on goal difference. Asked how many points might be need to be crowned champions, Pellegrini said: “It’s impossible to guess the future. I said before the end of first round of leagues maybe the winner has less than 80 points. It’s impossible to know – I am sure the champions [will have] around 75 points or more.” Yaya Touré missed the loss at Liverpool but is fit return on Saturday. “Yaya has an important kick on his heel,” he said. That’s why he couldn’t play Wednesday but he’s OK.” This week the top-ranking executives of the so-called big five clubs – City, United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool – met organisers of the International Champions Cup, a pre-season tournament, and discussed potential changes to the Champions League. Pellegrini said: “In this moment the Champions League is very important and the Premier League is the best in the world so to make changes is not easy. Maybe they can be improved [a little]. I don’t think you can talk about any of this in just a few words.”\n",
      "Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action 1) Long-term Matip injury would be significant Hands have been wrung and doom predicted about Philippe Coutinho’s injury, likely to keep him out of the Liverpool team until next month. And to an extent, rightly so: he has been their most impressive attacking threat this season, and the sight of that front four dovetailing has perhaps been the most pleasing in the division. However, the 4-3 defeat to Bournemouth on Sunday suggested that another injury absence might be more significant, namely Joël Matip. The Cameroonian centre-half has been a quiet, calm example of consistency, exactly the sort of thing that Liverpool missed against Bournemouth. The simple scoreline, plus a cursory viewing of the game, indicated Jürgen Klopp’s men will be okay scoring goals without Coutinho, but preventing them without Matip who has a minor ankle injury, could be more problematic. Nick Miller • Match report: Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool • Klopp defends Karius after late collapse • Barney Ronay: Fraser inspires madcap turnaround 2) Ledley and Puncheon do the damage The mood at Selhurst Park after this result was of a corner turned. That, it seems fair to say, is a tad premature. Six defeats in a row do not happen by chance and Alan Pardew faces Manchester United and Chelsea after the crucial fixture at Hull City next weekend. But one distinct positive for Crystal Palace’s fans will have been the resilience shown by Pardew’s players in a disciplined win against Southampton. Key to the performance were three players who starred in Tony Pulis’s Palace incarnation: Damien Delaney, Joe Ledley and Jason Puncheon. Their play was characterised by hard work, physicality, and taking the right decisions at the right times. Delaney kept Charlie Austin shackled, Ledley unsettled Saints’ passing rhythm and it was a typically smart piece of anticipation from Puncheon that led to their third goal. It all added up to Palace never truly being threatened by Claude Puel’s misfiring side, who lost concentration at crucial moments. Paul MacInnes • Match report: Crystal Palace 3-0 Southampton • Pardew eases the pressure, then criticises owners 3) Mourinho losing his touch and United losing points The troubling thing about José Mourinho in the past 18 months or so is that new weaknesses keep emerging in his teams. His apparent ability to get players to do anything for him went west, as did defensive solidity, and now there is apparently a lack of mental fortitude. The late penalty conceded fairly clownishly by Marouane Fellaini, then converted by Leighton Baines, was the fifth goal Manchester United have conceded in the last 10 minutes of games this season, costing them eight points. Those points would have put them just one behind Manchester City and snapping around the Champions League places: as it is they are a fairly distant sixth. Mourinho protested after the game that in all his team’s six draws they have been the better side, but it’s not much use if they continually throw results and points away at the last. NM • Mourinho sticks to script after draw • Mkhitaryan finally makes case as a United player 4) Cleverley fails to impose himself on Everton team It was interesting that, in response to a series of lacklustre performances, Ross Barkley was the man dropped from the Everton side by Ronald Koeman against Manchester United. Yet whether you think his demotion was harsh or not, not many could defend the identity of his replacement. It was tricky not to feel sorry for Tom Cleverley, removed after 65 insipid minutes to the sound of cheers from his own fans, but you can also understand why those fans were happy to see him go. It’s seven years since he made his senior debut and, in that time, he hasn’t really made clear exactly what sort of player he is, and the question that poses itself is: what’s he for? The moment that seemed to irk the Goodison crowd most came when he played a backwards pass near the edge of the United area as an attack built, thus removing all momentum from it, and seemed to sum him up neatly. Perhaps Barkley does need a spell out of the team, but replacing him with Cleverley, a player for whom a sideways pass seems to represent the height of ambition, is not the way to go. NM • Match report: Everton 1-1 Manchester United 5) City have no excuse despite referee mistake Leaving aside the touchline fracas when the game was won, the major debate at the Etihad Stadium was over whether David Luiz should have stayed on the pitch long enough to be fouled by Sergio Agüero in the final minute. The fact that he was the last defender when he illegally blocked Agüero’s run on goal in the first half is not really the point. The rulebook makes no mention of last defender, despite the term’s common usage, focusing instead on whether a clear goalscoring opportunity has been denied. That is of course harder to judge, and it seemed to everyone present that Anthony Taylor bottled out of making a judgment by pretending nothing had happened. Doubtless the referee would have been criticised too had he dismissed David Luiz, because he was still a long way from goal, and there would have been even greater outrage had he booked the defender, which is the least the offence deserved, and let him stay on the field. Yet some sympathy for the official is possible. There is no room for compromise in these situations, referees must choose between all or nothing. Taylor chose nothing, perhaps wrongly. Manchester City still had an hour of football and the useful gift of an own goal to try to get over it.

They had a similar problem when they were in the top flight in 2009–10 too, that time winning just one, drawing one and losing the rest. The pattern seems to be repeating itself this season: the 2-0 defeat at Stoke on Saturday was their fifth reverse in six games on the road, and the only time they have avoided a loss was a goalless draw at Old Trafford at the end of October. Maybe even more troubling is that they have scored only once away from Turf Moor, a penalty consolation in a 3-1 defeat at Southampton. Sean Dyche was quick to criticise Stoke’s apparent gamesmanship and the refereeing on Saturday, but that is not the reason they’re falling down the table. NM • Match report: Stoke City 2-0 Burnley 7) More wins could lead to more Short money Sunderland’s manager smiled at the suggestion his players were starting to resemble a “David Moyes team”. It has taken time but Moyes is showing his ability by somehow making the Wearside team look much more than the sum of their parts. If specialist defensive tutorials with Lamine Koné and Papy Djilobodji have helped, his attacking work on Victor Anichebe has been transformative. Three vindicating wins in four games have bred optimism but, to maintain the upward trajectory, Moyes wants victory in a trio of key games this month against Swansea City, Watford and Burnley. Such success would represent more than the collection of nine crucial points; it might persuade Ellis Short, the club’s owner, to invest in much needed playing reinforcements next month. Short would welcome a takeover but securing one might involve a little speculating to accumulate, preferably starting with Yann M’Vila’s long awaited importation from Rubin Kazan. Louise Taylor • Match report: Sunderland 2-1 Leicester City • Koné’s return to form a factor in Sunderland’s renaissance 8) Past performance could be guide to Spurs’ gain Are Tottenham Hotspur ready to make their move again? When Spurs lost at Chelsea on the Saturday before last, their Premier League record stood at W6 D6 L1 and they sat fifth in the table, which was a mirror image of their numbers from the corresponding point of last season. Last time out they then drew at home against Chelsea, whereas on Saturday they hammered Swansea City. In other words, Spurs are statistically better off now than when compared with their superb season of 2015‑16. What happened last season was they went on an extraordinary run at around this time. Can Mauricio Pochettino’s team fashion a repeat? Their elimination from the Champions League was a blow but they could benefit from a clarity of domestic focus. Harry Kane is back from injury and firing and there were signs of greater collective fluency against Swansea. Pochettino’s players have tended to enjoy a physical dividend from his conditioning programme. He senses a turning point. David Hytner • Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 5-0 Swansea City 9) Evans and McAuley will give Costa a true test When Chelsea try to extend their Premier League winning sequence to nine matches on Sunday, they will be confronted by better defenders than they found at Manchester City on Saturday. Few teams have a central defence as strong as West Bromwich Albion’s Northern Irish-axis. Jonny Evans is a consummate defender whom John Stones, for instance, might have benefited from studying if Evans had not been deployed in midfield when City won at West Bromwich in October. And Gareth McAuley, who turns 37 on Monday, has played every minute of every league match for Albion this season and been superb for most of them: strong, savvy and like Evans, always liable to contribute a goal from set pieces. Watching Diego Costa – on excellent form himself – take on that pair at Stamford Bridge should be one of the highlights of next weekend.

Their return of 1.7 points per game in the Premier League was a slight increase on previous years, but a costly Champions League draw against Paris Saint-Germain and the tame defeat of Wenger’s second string by Southampton in the EFL Cup last week showed his side remain vulnerable. The dismantling of a West Ham side in disarray was the perfect response, even if Arsenal’s manager knows there will be much stiffer tests ahead with trips to Everton and Manchester City to come this month. “Recently, we lost a little bit the quality of our game, and we started [to lose] a little bit with results,” he said. “A draw here, a draw there, a draw against PSG that was not completely convincing, and today we found the flow again. So I think we just have to concentrate on the quality of our game and try to repeat that week in, week out.” Ed Aarons • Match report: West Ham 1-5 Arsenal • Bilic bears burden of expectation as bubble bursts\n",
      "Swansea City’s owners to make huge profit with sale to US investors The owners of Swansea City, whose partnership with the supporters trust has long been hailed as ideal for a British football club, are set to make millions by selling their shares to American investors. The deal, signed in principle by the chairman, Huw Jenkins, values Swansea at around £100m, exactly 100 times more than the £1m paid for the club by the nine shareholders, including the trust, during and after a financial crisis in 2002. The agreement proposes the eight shareholders apart from the trust – which owns 21.1% of the club and whose elected director, Huw Cooze, was furious at being kept unaware of the negotiations – sell most of their shares to a consortium led by the US sports team investors Stephen Kaplan and Jason Levien. Intense discussions since have led to suggestions not all the shareholders will sell, and Levien and Kaplan may buy only a 60% stake, but their valuation, for a Premier League club awaiting the next tranche of vast TV fortunes starting next season, remains around £100m. So Jenkins’ 13.2% stake, which cost him £125,000 to buy, is valued at £13.2m. He is understood not to be planning to sell all his shares and is likely to remain the chairman if the takeover completes, because he is widely credited with having run the club with great acumen, alongside the other directors. The local hotelier Martin Morgan and his wife, Louisa, are the largest shareholders with a 23.7% stake, which cost £225,000 to buy; it is now valued by Kaplan and Levien at around £23.7m. Martin Morgan is said not to be intending to sell, and Levien may try to have separate discussions with Louisa Morgan, who controls more than half of their stake. One of the original 2002 investors, the South African businessman Brian Katzen, owns 10.5% of the club, as does his business partner, Jeffrey Crevoiserat; the stakes cost each man £100,000 when Swansea were floundering near the bottom of the Football League at a rundown Vetch Field, and are now valued at £10.5m each. Robert Davies, another original investor, also a financial backer of Swansea’s Ospreys rugby union region which shares the Liberty Stadium, also has a 10.5% stake. The Dutch investor John van Zweden, and Leigh Dineen, formerly the trust’s elected director who bought his own shares for £50,000, both have stakes of just over 5%, now valued at £5m. The millions to be made by the shareholders who do sell follow £4m already paid to them all in dividends over the past four years – £1m, in effect their original stakes repaid, each year from 2012-15 since Swansea have been in the Premier League. Paid proportionately according to their stakes, Jenkins has received more than £500,000; Martin and Louisa Morgan £900,000; Katzen, Crevoiserat and Davies £400,000 each, and Van Zweden and Dineen around £200,000 each. The trust, for its 21.1%, has been paid more than £800,000, which it has used to buy new shares and for a “rainy day” fund. Established as a mutual, democratic, not-for-profit body during Swansea’s 2001 financial crisis, with the help of the fan-ownership initiative Supporters Direct, the trust’s members who have provided contributions for the £200,000 investment cannot cash in personally if the trust ever sells. Cooze, who has told a trust forum he was “pretty damned hurt” at the secrecy of the negotiations, is now seeking to rebuild bridges with his co-directors and safeguard the trust’s position. Levien’s revised suggestion to buy 60% is intended to show the trust a preparedness to work with them, after supporters’ hostile reaction to the proposed acquisition of 75.1% control. Cooze and the trust’s chairman, Phil Sumbler, say they knew the other shareholders would sell at some point and are sanguine about them making so much money. They mostly want to know whether the sale to Levien and Kaplan, which Jenkins in his official statement said he believed “will help the club progress on and off the field”, will bring actual investment into the club itself. “There is no point in a deal without money for the club; that would just be a sale for the shareholders’ personal gain,” Sumbler said. He pointed out that supporters’ unpaid work and donations have contributed to Swansea’s remarkable revival over the past 15 years and massive increase in financial value. “The shareholders are mostly lifelong fans, and we have always believed throughout our partnership with them that they have the best interests of the club at heart.” Levien, a lawyer, is the managing general partner of Washington’s Major League Soccer team, DC United, having previously been involved at three NBA basketball franchises, including the Memphis Grizzlies, to which he introduced Kaplan as an investor. Kaplan, the principal of Oaktree Capital investment fund, is thought to be the largest proposed investor in the acquisition, with several others so far not named. Levien has been assuring people they have substantial money and are not financing the deal with debt. In meetings with the shareholders in Swansea last week, Levien is understood to have emphasised their plan is to develop the club but has not made firm promises that the consortium will invest new money of their own for signing players or expanding the stadium. Like other US investors increasingly taking over clubs, Levien and Kaplan are attracted by the Premier League’s success, the huge TV income, expected to be £8bn across the league for the three years from next season, and the prospect of growth in popularity and earnings, particularly in America, over the next 10-15 years. The US culture of sports team ownership is much more avowedly commercial than British football’s traditional local “benefactor” shareholders, who have mostly sold out in the Premier League years. Investors in American sports seek to make money by growing their franchises commercially and therefore increasing their value, and that of their own stakes. Levien and Kaplan’s plan is to do the same at Swansea, and promoting the club in the US is thought to be a key feature of the proposed deal. All of which is a world away from the crumbling, loss-making club the shareholders, galvanised by the trust and wider supporter efforts, bought for £20,000 in January 2002, putting the rest of the money in to pay off debt. Chroniclers of Swansea’s spectacular upward flight since occasionally miss out two key boosts: a company voluntary arrangement, by which creditors settled for only 5p in every pound, and the great gift of the £27m Liberty Stadium, which is still owned by the local council. Now, as thousands of jobs locally are threatened in the Port Talbot steelworks, the Swansea City shareholders’ proposed gains highlight again modern football’s stand-out riches, in increasingly post-industrial cities where the clubs evolved more than a century ago. Jenkins and Dineen declined to comment on the proposed sale, citing confidentiality agreements. Katzen said of his original motivation that he was keen on football and the challenge, and said they were all determined to make progress and run the club as a business, but never envisaged the success they have had, and these exponential profits. “It has been 15 years, a lot of work; it’s not a quick buck,” Katzen said. “Nobody expected to get anything out of the club at the beginning.”\n",
      "Football transfer rumours: Romelu Lukaku going back to Chelsea? What must Diego Costa think? Chelsea are fully within their rights to tell Atlético Madrid to do one with their approaches, but now that story appears to have reached a dead end, the cantankerous 27-year-old Spain striker is finding out that Antonio Conte has an eye on several other attacking options. First up, Romelu Lukaku is a target – but would the Belgian really want to come back to Stamford Bridge, and face a battle for a starting position when he is the undisputed first choice at Everton? That may just be a plan B if Chelsea’s move for Álvaro Morata fails to come up trumps. Morata has only rejoined Real Madrid after they activated his buy-back clause at Juventus, but Chelsea have already made two bids and may go back for a third. Let’s not forget he was chosen in Spain’s Euro 2016 squad instead of Costa. That’s before mentioning Michy Batshuayi’s solid debut in Chelsea’s friendly win over Wolfsberger last night. Conte is in no mood to sell Andreas Christensen to Borussia Mönchengladbach, though. The 20-year-old is halfway through a two season loan at the Bundesliga club, who have been sufficiently impressed to offer almost £15m. That’s not enough in Chelsea’s books. After a 1-0 humbling against former club Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola has decided he needs to bring craft to his Manchester City midfield and will table a bid for Real Madrid’s Toni Kroos. Reunification is in fashion. Guardiola is also reeling from the news that his first game will not be against The Big Sam , with Sunderland in talks with David Moyes about taking over at the Stadium of Light. Hull, worryingly, are not being linked with anybody, despite eight of the 14 senior players under contract being injured and just over three weeks to go before the season starts. At least Steve Bruce is staying, though. Oh Nacer, Nacer Chadli has caught the eye of Swansea, who may be willing to fork out £10m to purchase the Belgium midfielder from Tottenham. Daniel Levy would rather £15m, mind. Action is imminent at West Brom, where Saido Berahino might finally be sold 347 windows after a move from the Hawthorns was initially mooted and Jeffrey Schlupp could be on his way in to Tony Pulis’ squad after an offer was made to Leicester. And how could a Rumour Mill end without a mention of Manchester United? What a summer it has been at Old Trafford. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Eric Bailly, possibly Paul Pogba and now – perhaps the biggest one of all – Joshua Bohui is set to join from Brentford. Actually, that’s maybe even a tad too facetious for this column. Bohui is a promising 17-year-old winger who may end up being rather good, and will go into the academy.\n",
      "Why Pokémon Go really is a national health service If parenting is one long process of discovering that it doesn’t really happen like they say in the books, then school holidays are proof positive that Swallows and Amazons was fiction. Every July starts, at least in this house, with starry-eyed delusions about a summer spent messing about on rivers, climbing trees and having wholesome adventures. Or failing that, perhaps a summer of cheery educational play as per the more optimistic newspaper supplements, where the kids thrill to your kitchen science experiments and treasure hunts round National Trust properties. And every July ends with the realisation that actually it’s not going to be like that. We will not spend summer picnicking and playing beach cricket, because it is going to rain all August. We won’t be that family in the museum whose kids just beg to hear more about the ancient Egyptians, because we will be that family whose kid rolls its eyes sarcastically at the very idea of filling in the museum’s lovely quiz. There will be afternoons where nobody looks up from Minecraft. And yet a tiny flicker of hope remains, for this is the summer of the Pokémon Go app. The craze for this remarkably silly mobile phone game – which involves chasing cartoony little virtual monsters through the surrounding real world, as they pop into shot on your phone’s camera – is currently outstripped only by the craze for stories about stupid things people do while playing it. A holocaust museum in Washington was forced to remind visitors that it’s crassly inappropriate to catch imaginary gonks on your phone while wandering round a memorial to victims of genocide. Tragically, a teenager in Guatemala was shot while playing the game – although whether the game had anything to do with the death remains unclear. There are reports of drivers crashing cars while surreptitiously playing on their phones; and a woman rescued by emergency services after getting stuck up a tree while chasing Pokémon. Yet what makes Pokémon Go irresistible is that it’s basically a good old-fashioned treasure hunt crossed with a fairytale, adding up to that parenting holy grail: an excuse to go out in the fresh air and move. Friends with boys in the awkward tweens – too old and self-conscious for running round the garden, too young to hunker moodily in bedrooms – report a sudden revival of “playing out” in the park under the guise of Pokémon hunting. It’s as if the app gives them an excuse to be kids again. And those dry police reports about increased “foot traffic” in cities thanks to overgrown kidults playing the game? That’s code for what public health campaigns have struggled for decades to achieve, namely getting people out of the house and walking. If I were the NHS, I’d be pleading with Nintendo to cluster Pokémon characters along hiking routes and bike trails, up mountains and in woods. For every nine players who move through, not lifting their eyes off the phone, there will be one who looks up and sees something they might not otherwise have. Yet all new technology must seemingly pass through three stages before we can reach such acceptance, and Pokémon Go is no exception; first comes the fear that it’s somehow going to kill us (tick); second, the inevitable articles about how single women in New York are using it to meet men (tick); and finally a moral panic over what it supposedly reveals about human nature that actually we already knew (getting there). Yes, people have done dumb and risky things while playing Pokémon Go. But replace the words “playing Pokémon Go” with almost any activity and that sentence remains true. Why, it’s almost as if the fault lies with people, not with the tools we ingeniously devise to satisfy that most endearingly human of instincts: play. Talk of British creative industries, and people think of theatre, music or film. But gaming is a multibillion-pound player now, the point where arts meets tech, and as embedded in British culture as telly, without being quite so generously acknowledged. Having never got the bug myself, the sight of anyone hunched over a screen will never make my heart sing, but watching my son and his friends play dispels the fear that there’s something inherently antisocial about it. They don’t want to play alone, or with faceless strangers over the internet. What they crave is to be all in the same room, hooking up their individual devices to one Wi-Fi, building a sprawling collective Minecraft empire in which they share virtual adventures while chatting away in real life. They’re deep in an imaginary world, just as I was as a little girl playing shops, but it’s interleaved with the physical world around them, and they move quite naturally between the two. No wonder, then, that this summer’s hit isn’t some overhyped virtual reality game but an augmented reality one that takes game elements and overlays them on our shared real world. As all games do, it has the potential to get messy. There’s always someone who gets carried away, tips the Monopoly board over and ruins it for everyone. But humans will always want to play, and there’s something oddly moving about the lengths to which we will go to invent new games for each other. How touching that, after all this time, we still so badly want to play together.\n",
      "FA Cup must remain football’s hollow crown to maintain its magic Gary Lineker’s documentary on Leicester City’s title success the other night had an intentionally dreamlike quality. Even now, at a distance of just a few days from the end of a remarkable Premier League season, it is still tempting to wonder whether it all really happened. It did, of course, we can be sure of that. Otherwise Arsenal would now be champions, Tottenham kicking themselves even more than usual and Manchester United inviting Louis van Gaal to spend a bit more money in preparation for next season’s Champions League. There has been some debate in these pages over the last few days over whether United have improved this season, stood still or gone backwards. My conclusion was that they are ever so slowly getting better, based on the joint best defence in the division and some exciting discoveries up front in Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford. The league table suggests otherwise, and many were quick to point out that finishing fourth last season and fifth this time is a step back, not forward, though that can largely be explained by the Leicester effect. Take Leicester out of the equation, pretend for a moment that they did not confound bookies and pundits alike by coming from nowhere to finish on top, and United are pretty much where they were last season apart from having an FA Cup final to look forward to and a couple of new strikers to utilise. If some people had their way, the winners of Saturday’s showpiece at Wembley would be granted a place in next season’s Champions League as a reward. It has been suggested over and over again that the way to halt the decline of the FA Cup would be to make it a prize worth winning, and it is certainly true that were the competition to provide a route to the Champions League for the winners, in the way that the Europa League now does, then everyone would start taking it seriously again. Especially the big teams, or more specifically the big teams who might just finish fifth or sixth in the Premier League. Teams such as Manchester United in fact, who on several occasions in the past have been guilty of making the FA Cup the lowest of their priorities. Such a change, which would require Uefa to alter its rules, would probably fix the FA Cup, though it might not be the best idea in the long run for English success in the Champions League. Suppose Crystal Palace win on Saturday, for a start. Bearing in mind that the Premier League’s normal quota of four Champions League places is based on a coefficient that tracks English clubs’ record in Europe over the years, would it really be a good plan to send along a club that finished in 15th place and only managed a couple of league wins since the turn of the year? FA Cup winners in recent seasons have included Wigan and Portsmouth, while Aston Villa, Hull and Cardiff have appeared in finals in the last 10 years. Would it be entirely fair to send clubs like that into Europe’s premier competition, based on stringing four or five results together in the Cup, when the side that finish in fourth after the 38 games of the Premier League’s arduous season would then have to be content with a Europa League spot? Even Van Gaal thinks not, or at least he did a few weeks ago when the possibility was put to him. He might be more tempted to grab at the lifeline now, but last month he was of the opinion that a side with a lucky cup run should not win a bigger prize than those teams who have shown the most consistency over the course of a whole season. Though Leicester have given everyone pause for thought over what might be achieved by so-called lesser clubs, the fact they won the title by a clear 10 points is a sure indication of quality, consistency and durability. The Foxes have earned their shot at the big time next season and we are all fascinated to see how it will go. We might be equally fascinated were it to be Palace, Wigan or Villa lining up against Bayern Munich or Barcelona, though not for the same reasons. So, much as one would like to see the FA Cup receive a life-saving injection of importance, linking it to Champions League qualification seems fraught with risk. Except that the issue of small clubs taking the place of bigger clubs in Europe would possibly not arise so often once the big clubs got their act together and realised the FA Cup could be their golden ticket. Upsets would become much less frequent if everybody suddenly began to regard FA Cup progress as vital, and stopped switching goalkeepers, resting players or trying out a few youngsters. Over time the Cup would just become a top-four event again, as it was in the 11 years from 1996 to 2007, when everyone complained the romance had died. Funny thing though, romance. Everyone said it was back when Portsmouth broke the mould in 2008, and again when Wigan beat Manchester City in 2013, yet for both those clubs Wembley glory prefaced a sharp downturn in fortunes. What would probably happen, with Champions League qualification as a prize, is that lucky cup runs – the kind of thing that took Palace to Wembley this time – would become a thing of the past. Van Gaal’s reservations would become less relevant; if everyone was trying their best and putting out their strongest teams then winning the six games (for leading clubs) necessary to lift the trophy would be a feat deserving of reward. But no more so than holding on for fourth place in the table. Hoping to use the lure of the Champions League to return the glamour to the FA Cup would not restore the old magic, it would just turn the competition into an annexe of the Premier League. It is regrettable that Saturday’s Wembley winners will end up with little more than a hollow crown, but could anyone seriously argue that either side deserves to be in the Champions League next season?\n",
      "May the fourth be with you: United and City in final-day battle of Manchester The last day of the Premier League season confirms a power shift has finally taken place. The Midlands is now the centre of attention, something not many observers imagined they would live to see, with Tottenham and Arsenal well represented for a change as north London fills the next two automatic Champions League qualification slots. The two Manchester clubs, like bald men fighting over a comb, are now reduced to a tussle over who finishes in fourth place, the one with the extra qualifying round. Considering the financial resources at their disposal this is undeniable underachievement. Manuel Pellegrini can spout all the statistics he likes, just as Louis van Gaal can blame injuries and bad luck, but the two clubs have never been wealthier yet this season is going to be the first in Premier League history without either of them in the top three. City began to feature at the awards end of the table around five seasons ago, the proud Mancunian record is otherwise entirely down to United and the Sir Alex Ferguson years. Yet before United dominated the football landscape Liverpool did, and one has to go back 35 years, to the last time a Midlands team was crowned champions, to find a top three with no representation from the north-west. Aston Villa’s title-winning season in 1981 was something of a one-off too, even more than it must seem from the perspective of a side just relegated to the Championship. The previous occasion when north-west clubs were absent from the podium was 1961, when Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves finished second and third in Tottenham’s Double-winning season. With that historical context in mind, finishing in fourth should not really count for anything at all. If second is nowhere, as Bill Shankly always used to maintain, fourth might as well be in a different division. The Champions League has altered how we view these things: fourth place is now considered more important than winning one of the cups, but the Champions League is supposed to be an old pals’ act, a self-perpetuating, self-aggrandising elite whereby the same big, rich clubs just get bigger and richer and hoover up everyone else’s best players so that smaller clubs can do little more than stand on the pavement outside and look in through the window. That is why everyone enjoyed Leicester’s gatecrashing act so much. City very much want to be among the grandees of Europe; United used to be comfortable in that company until losing their way in the later stages of Ferguson’s reign, though by definition you cannot be a bona fide Champions League contender if you are still scrabbling around for qualification on the final day of the season. Even if City did reach the semi-final, the manner in which they ultimately slid out of view did nothing to suggest regular reachers of the last four will be hoping to avoid them next season. That is what Pep Guardiola is about to take over, regardless of whether City stay in fourth place. There will be much tittering from the red half of Manchester if their new luxury coach arrives to supervise a Europa League campaign, though apart from the initial indignity there is no real reason why City could not survive a season out of the Champions League. Most teams are in it for the money; City already have plenty of that. City have hired Guardiola to take them to the next level in Europe; fair enough, but does he have to do it in his first season? On the evidence of the domestic season now concluding Guardiola will have enough of a rebuilding job on his hands just turning City back into the strongest team in England. They have never managed to look really convincing in Europe and though Guardiola might be exactly the man to effect that transformation it is a big ask to expect him to do it straight away. United do not really need the Champions League either. They have just announced record profits for the latest financial quarter, their money-making machine could survive a short holiday from the hot spots and hot shots of Europe. Van Gaal’s job is supposed to be hanging on a fourth-place finish, but he managed that last season and United found themselves out of the Champions League before Christmas. Were he to take advantage of any City slip-up at Swansea and sneak into fourth with a United win against Bournemouth on Sunday afternoon he would probably be safe for another season, especially if he can bring home the FA Cup next Saturday, though it is a moot question whether that would be a cause for celebration in and around Old Trafford. What most people think United should do at this point is make a clear statement about who will be in charge next season, and possibly beyond. A team that could have been dumped out of the Europa League by Midtjylland had they not promoted Marcus Rashford in the nick of time really has no business waiting around to see if Champions League qualification can help them arrive at a decision. United appear to be adhering to the traditional view, as expressed by Pellegrini in his final press conference in Manchester. “For a big team, if you don’t qualify for the Champions League it is a disaster,” he said. But Pellegrini went on to say something else. “I don’t think it matters for one year – as happened to United in 2014 and Chelsea this season – but it is not the best thing for it to happen over a number of years.” Quite. With the money United offer players, and the prospect of working under Guardiola at City, it is probably not even true that transfer targets would turn their noses up because of non-Champions League status. What is true is that the very best players, Renato Sanches being a case in point, will always want to join the best clubs. Doubtless to Guardiola’s chagrin, Bayern Munich have reached only Champions League semi-finals in his three years in Germany, though they do boast three successive league titles. That is consistency of a sort and even if the German model is not to be preferred to the unpredictability of the Premier League it starts at home. The plain, unvarnished truth is that the pride of Manchester, whichever side finishes highest, has some catching up to do on the domestic front before entertaining dreams of conquering Europe.\n",
      "Danny Willett's brother steals spotlight on Twitter after Masters 2016 victory Danny Willett might have come from nowhere to take the Masters. But it was his brother, PJ, tweeting the final hours of the tournament from his home in Birmingham, who stole the spotlight. PJ Willett, who describes himself as “Author. Teacher. Inexperienced Father” on his Twitter profile, swore, drank and joked his way through the tense close to the four-day contest that saw his brother become only the second Englishman to wear the famous green jacket. His tweets included digs at Willett’s rival, Jordan Spieth, as well untempered emotion as his brother edged closer to the win. At times, his tweets veered into the profane. But they also demonstrated his unrivalled joy at his brother’s outstanding performance. And were often totally hilarious. When it became clear that his younger brother had beaten Spieth to take the US Masters title he was overcome. His outpouring won him fans from across the golfing world, and beyond. Willett’s tweets were so popular that he started trending in the UK. And he seemed rather pleased with his handiwork. At the same time, sporting greats were paying tribute to Willett’s victory, including former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan, who shares his hometown, Sheffield, with Willett. In a reference to the tradition where the Masters winner chooses the menu for the following year’s champions’ dinner, the 2008 winner, South Africa’s Trevor Immelman, tweeted: “Bangers and mash this time next year....”\n",
      "Eric Black’s optimism for Aston Villa fails to address pressing issues The depth of the crisis at Aston Villa is summed up by Doug Ellis urging the current owner Randy Lerner to take a “more hands-on approach”. Ellis was not the most popular proprietor of the club before he sold Villa to the American in 2006. The buck for Villa’s first relegation of the Premier League era, though, stops with Lerner and Ellis’s message to him resonates. “I only wish he could spend a little more time in the UK supporting Aston Villa rather than following them on his phone or on his television,” Ellis told the BBC. “He made a promise to put in £200m and he has kept that promise, and I made my promise not to interfere and I have not broken my word.” The first thing Lerner should do is reverse a culture of excuses. After this defeat to Manchester United confirmed Villa’s drop into the Championship, Eric Black was twice offered the chance to describe their campaign as a shambles yet the caretaker-manager hid behind platitudes. He was speaking as Joleon Lescott claimed that going down was a “weight off” the team’s shoulders; the latest disconnect between club and fans in a season studded with miserable displays and unprofessional conduct. Villa have been bottom of the table since 25 October after 10 games, when they had four points, two fewer than Newcastle United and Sunderland. In the 24 games since, the 1982 European Cup winners have taken a barely credible 12 points. Yet when asked if shambolic was a fair description of this, Black refused to send a message to the Villa players and, just as importantly, their fans, which is simply not good enough. “Everyone has their own adjectives they like to use,” said the Scot. “It has been a difficult season for everybody involved with Aston Villa. Having spoken to a lot of people at Villa the only thing that is in their mind is taking this big club back and, hopefully, the supporters will get a feeling for that. “There is no point standing here and criticising. That’s done, it’s over; we should be looking to rebuild and if that can start on Monday morning then great, because this is a fantastic football club. There is nobody who would deny that.” Perhaps Black could explain to travelling Villa fans why there is no point criticising. Especially after witnessing Marcus Rashford’s seventh goal for United consign Villa to a 24th league defeat. Or after he appeared hard-pressed to convince all of his players to applaud their loyal support, who had lent Old Trafford the sort of atmosphere one might expect from the home fans. Admittedly Black has only been in charge since 31 March, but given he is not responsible for the shambles, there was more freedom for him to speak clearly. Who might take over permanently is a crucial decision for Lerner and a new executive board, which includes the chairman Steve Hollis, former player and manager Brian Little and Adrian Bevington, once a high-ranking Football Association executive. David Moyes, Nigel Pearson, and Brendan Rodgers are all being mentioned. Each would be sure to try to establish the fierce work ethic, focus and stability required. But would they take the job? Black believes there will be a queue to do so. “I am sure there will be a thousand people who will want to sit in that seat,” he said. “The infrastructure of the club is set, there are fantastic facilities and the stadium and supporters are second to none. “I don’t know how many clubs would have 30,000-35,000 coming to games when they have hardly seen a victory. They deserve enormous credit for that. The stadium is in place. We need to rebuild the team into something the supporters can be proud of.” The big challenge now is for Villa to bounce straight back up. If they do not, and remain outside the Premier League for the next three years, they could lose £200m in broadcast revenue alone. Black said: “It is going to be very difficult but I don’t think anybody is under any illusions. There are an extra eight games to start with. The physicality is different to the Premier League and we are a big, big fish in [the Championship]. These are all elements you have to consider. I don’t think anybody is under any illusion this is going to be plain sailing. It is a fantastic challenge and one people at this club will be trying their utmost to meet. “I am sure whoever takes over will ensure that work ethic carries on and if we can get the right squad together then we can bounce straight back, but it will be no easy task.” The challenge starts now.

      "Jay Z shades Phil Jackson's 'posse' remark at Sports Illustrated LeBron fete Jay Z took a shot at New York Knicks president Phil Jackson’s use of the term “posse” in reference to LeBron James’ business partners during his speech to introduce the Cleveland Cavaliers star as Sports Illustrated’s Sportperson of the Year on Monday night. The musician’s remarks praised James as “the son who honors and worships his mother, Gloria. The friend who put his posse in position.” The audience at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn laughed at the reference to Jackson’s comment as James appeared to playfully mouth “shut up” from his table. “We do understand where we come from, and the only difference between us and someone who has their MBA from Wharton or Sloan or Berkeley or Stanford is opportunity. LeBron James has provided his friends with that opportunity. And as we witness their development, and if we’re looking up at the scoreboard, very few, very few businessmen are better than Maverick Carter, Rich Paul, Randy Mims and all the rest of the ‘posse’ behind the scenes that make it look like they’re just hanging out. “LeBron James has made all of those around him better on and off the court. We acknowledge and recognize all he has done for the game. But tonight, LeBron, we say thank you. Not just for your commitment to basketball. We say thank you for all you have done in the community. And thank you for how you’ve enriched the lives of everyone around you. You messed around and got a triple-double in real life.” Jackson, twice an NBA champion as a Knicks player and the winner of a league-record 11 titles as a coach with the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, had used the term in an interview with ESPN last month. “It had to hurt when [the Miami Heat] lost LeBron,” Jackson said. “That was definitely a slap in the face. But there were a lot of little things that came out of that. When LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland, and he wanted to spend the night. They don’t do overnights. Teams just don’t. So now [coach Erik] Spoelstra has to text [Pat] Riley and say, ‘What do I do in this situation?’ And Pat, who has iron-fist rules, answers: ‘You are on the plane. You are with this team.’ You can’t hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland. “I always thought Pat had this really nice vibe with his guys. But something happened there where it broke down. I do know LeBron likes special treatment. He needs things his way.” James responded harshly to the use of the term, saying it carries a connotation that underscores the difficulties young African-Americans have in gaining respect, especially in the business world. The four-times NBA Most Valuable Player drew further attention on Monday when the cover of the Sportsperson of the Year issue was unveiled featuring a portrait of James wearing a safety pin on his lapel. Since last month’s presidential election, the safety pin has become a symbol of solidarity with those Americans who fear they will be disenfranchised by a Donald Trump presidency. The pin is intended to show that the wearer is a safe person to turn to. James campaigned for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the days before the vote. During a recent road trip, James opted to stay elsewhere than the team’s official Trump-branded hotel in New York. He called the decision a personal preference.\n",
      "Anthony Mackie to play Johnnie Cochran in police brutality drama Anthony Mackie is set to follow in the recent footsteps of Courtney B Vance by playing Johnnie Cochran, in a new film about a landmark police brutality case. According to Deadline, the Captain America: Civil War star will play the lawyer during a 1981 case that preceded his defence of OJ Simpson in 1995, a trial that was recently dramatised for the small screen. The role of Cochran in the TV series, The People v OJ Simpson, was played by Vance in a widely-praised performance. The as yet untitled big-screen drama focuses on the story of American football player Ron Settles, who was arrested for speeding and later found dead in his cell. It was initially deemed a suicide, but an autopsy showed that Settles had been choked to death. The family were awarded $760,000 in a civil suit and the police chief resigned. The film is written by David McMillan, who has worked on TV drama Lucifer, with a director yet to be announced. Mackie is currently starring in Captain America: Civil War, after roles in Triple 9 and The Night Before and will next be seen on television, playing Martin Luther King Jr in the HBO drama All the Way. He’s also set to star in thriller Wetlands and is developing a film about Olympian sprinter Jesse Owens. As well as OJ Simpson, Cochran’s celebrity clients included Michael Jackson, Tupac and Snoop Dogg. He died in 2005.\n",
      "Premier League fans’ verdicts – the run-in, part 1: Arsenal to Manchester United ARSENAL What is the mood among fans? An abiding mood of frustration, knowing that our competitors are unlikely EVER to offer us a better opportunity to bring home the Premier League bacon. We’re torn between the faint hope of the very worthy Foxes faltering and the possibility of them leaving the door open, only for the unthinkable consequence of Spurs charging through it. How is the manager doing? Although it’s hard to envisage a last-ditch title tilt, at long last Arsène appears to have chanced upon a more balanced looking side and if we should finally produce the consistency to finish above Spurs, I wonder if this will be sufficient to get so many of those who have lost faith in him back on side? Which players have been shining lights? For their unsung consistency, Monreal, Koscielny and Bellerín. Yet of late it’s been the homegrown Iwobi and the bargain buy Elneny creating a spark of optimism. Which players have left you unimpressed? Theo Walcott is an extremely likeable lad but most Gooners have lost patience. There’s also great disappointment that Ramsey and Sánchez have failed to reproduce their feats from last term. Where do you think your team will finish? Second looks to be the most feasible limit of our ambitions, but all that really matters now is finishing above our increasingly noisy neighbours.

It has switched from fury to apathy to mild optimism about what a new, promotion-specialist manager could do over the next two years. The new boardroom broom has started well (only Garde to go), but the choice of new boss is the biggest test. My sense is that Moyes is the preferred choice with Pearson, Pulis and Rodgers in the “they’ll do” camp. The alleged deep football thinkers will doubtless baulk at the unoriginality, but pragmatism is required. Manager? Hopefully it will be a caretaker by the time this is printed … Sadly, Garde never gave any sign of possessing the coaching ability, the tactical nous or the mental toughness required. Goodbye rather than au revoir. Shining lights? Gueye has improved since it became clear he needed a new club. That the rest haven’t shows they were hopeless in the first place and not simply shirking. Ayew is our best player by far. Unimpressed? Guzan is an easy target and has lost his confidence. If Richards was as good as he thinks he is, we’d have stayed up. His inane, self-publicising social media ramblings are nearly in Lescott’s class. That Garde picks the same team every week suggests that the Under-21s are useless as well. Finish? Adrift at the bottom Predictions Top 4 Leicester, Tottenham, Arsenal, Man United.

I hope Roy Hodgson has a good Euro 2016 as we don’t want to lose Eddie. I can’t see Eddie Howe leaving AFC Bournemouth for another Premier League club. It would just not sit easy with him. Shining lights? They are all stars, to be honest, but the return of Max Gradel was significant and the most consistent player has been Charlie Daniels. Unimpressed? I suppose I find Glenn Murray’s signing a strange one. While he has scored a few goals he does not really fit into the way the team plays. I can’t knock his effort, though. Finish?

The mood has been one of resignation for most of the season. There was a mild flirtation with anger, but to be honest May just can’t come quick enough for us. Manager? Hiddink Mk 2 isn’t half as effective as Hiddink Mk 1. He seems to set up teams to not lose rather than win. The football is dull and the points haul isn’t much better than the beginning of the season under Mourinho. The players know that he’s not the one they need to impress. Shining lights? No “s” required. It’s singular. Willian is the only player who can hold his head up high – the rest of them have tipped the scale anywhere between “average” to “are you actually a professional footballer?” Unimpressed? How much space is there? Courtois – from most sought-after young keeper in the world to a shadow of his former self. Oscar – with so many body-parts missing I’m not sure how he even takes to the field: no heart, no spine, no guts, no left leg, need I go on? Hazard – call Mulder and Scully, there appears to have been an invasion of the body snatchers. Matic – where to start? From a ruthless machine (José called him a “monster”) to midfield dead-weight.

We are in the fourth FA Cup semi-final in our history and seven points clear of relegation with eight games left. And yet, we have not won in the league since 19 December, have the worst league record in the top four divisions in 2016 and have equalled our worst run of home defeats in our history (six). The fans are looking forward to Wembley, but opinions on Alan Pardew are becoming split. A win against Norwich on 9 April is a must to put any fears of relegation to bed. Manager? You can see that the pressure is getting to Pardew now and his outburst against Jamie Carragher in his recent programme notes was telling. He has no excuse with injuries now as Wickham and McArthur apart we have a fully fit squad. There seems to be no plan B to stop this disastrous run. Even if we stay up the fear is we will tailspin straight into the next campaign. Shining lights? Wilfried Zaha continues to deliver and Bolasie is starting to get back towards his pre-injury form. Wickham had a hit a brilliant level of form but then got injured, which sums up Palace’s season. Unimpressed? Pape Souaré’s form has taken an alarming dip. Adebayor has impressed in fits and starts, but is not getting much service. Cabaye’s early-season pomp has vanished. Finish? 15th. Predictions Top 4 Leicester, Tottenham, Arsenal, Man United.

It’s divided with most Everton fans. Absolutely delighted to be going to Wembley for the semi-final of the FA Cup, especially after a great result against Chelsea. But disappointed to be below mid-table with only five wins at Goodison. Too many games have been lost from winning positions. Manager? I’m still with Roberto, but I’ll give him until the end of the season. He needs to learn how to hold on to winning positions. We’ve dropped too many points, especially at home. Some bad substitute decisions have lost us games. Shining lights? Without a doubt Lukaku has been outstanding, breaking records with his goalscoring. Ross Barkley has matured and added goals to his game and Aaron Lennon has surprised me with his constantly good performances, taking over from Gerard Deulofeu who was outstanding at the beginning of the season. Unimpressed? Unfortunately time has caught up with Tim Howard, but he’s been a great servant to Everton for 10 years. I’m still not convinced about Tom Cleverley, but hope he comes good. Finish?

Unadulterated jubilation, unsurprisingly. Perhaps, the nerves are starting to set in now we’re in the home straight but nothing can dampen our spirits at the moment. Manager? He’s the league’s best on current form. We were mocked for appointing Ranieri off the back of his tenure as Greece’s boss, but he’s done a sterling job for us and deserves every bit of praise going. Shining lights? Obviously Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy are the stand-out players but I’m vehement in my belief that N’Golo Kanté has been the club’s best player this term. His consistency defies belief. However, the whole squad has virtually been at the top of their game all season; Morgan and Drinkwater deserve plaudits for their marked improvements this year. Unimpressed? It’s hard to single any one player out. Ulloa has not played as well as he did last season but he’s still contributing with crucial goals here and there. Gökhan Inler has come in for some criticism too but given his lack of opportunity to break in to such an imperious midfield, I wouldn’t say I’m “unimpressed” by him. Finish?

We got to a final and lost but that didn’t ruin the day. We make the Europa League quarter-finals then three days later throw away a 2-0 lead against Southampton to lose 3-2. We could win the Europa League, we could win every game to the end of the season and just as easily lose them all and get no further in Europe. We’re kind of all over the place, but that’s OK as there’s a real feeling of optimism. Also still reeling over the success of Spirit of Shankly and other fan groups in getting our owners to capitulate and the Premier League fat cats to agree a £30 cap for next season’s away games. Manager? Klopp is a good fit for us and has united the fans. A big personality, he takes the heat off the team, doesn’t deflect from defeat and takes no personal praise from a victory. Never ingratiating, often entertaining and no fake tan. Shining lights? Firmino. Can has improved dramatically the past couple of months, and Coutinho. Lucas has been immense. Unimpressed?

Despondent. Despite our good form in the cups, our league form has been woeful – we haven’t won back-to-back matches since October and have managed 36 points from our past 25 league games. The club should be embarrassed given its resources. The mood took a further hit with the decision to charge up to £60 a ticket for the Champions League quarter-final with PSG. Ticket-pricing is, rightly, coming in for a lot of criticism. Manager? Struggled this season. Despite the successes of his first campaign, ultimately, the team has regressed. I like Pellegrini as a man but it’s stale football under stale management. The decision to announce Pep Guardiola’s arrival on 1 February has evidently backfired too, as there’s a real possibility of the Europa League next season. Shining lights? Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho and Joe Hart have been excellent. Coincidentally, they’re also our top three appearance-makers this season. Kelechi Iheanacho is an absolute star in the making. Unimpressed? Martín Demichelis has been excruciatingly bad at times, but he’s not really to blame, the club should have let him go in the summer and retained Jason Denayer. Wilfried Bony has been dreadful.

It’s been a poor season, we haven’t created enough chances, not scored enough goals and the football has been turgid. The facts on this are undeniable. We expected improvement but instead we’re worse this season than we were last. However, Louis van Gaal can still lead us to a top-four position and a trip to Wembley - though both are far from a given. Manager? He has an immense pedigree and is well-liked but unfortunately has failed to meet expectations. He has been handicapped by a dreadful run of injuries but poor performances, particularly mid-season, the awful exit from the Champions League, the inability to beat a poor Liverpool side over two legs in the Europa League and the continuing erratic results in the league probably mean he won’t be in charge come August. Shining lights? David de Gea continues to perform to the highest standards. Anthony Martial is a wonderful talent and hopefully will become a United legend, and the introduction of Marcus Rashford has given us something to look forward to. Unimpressed? Memphis Depay has been a constant source of disappointment. Matteo Darmian is erratic and unreliable. The appearance of Marouane Fellaini in a United shirt continues to baffle. Finish?

Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts? I work as part of a five-strong close-knit design team for a large media/graphic design company. We have some well-known, high-profile clients. As part of what we do – essentially coming up with bright ideas – we have to bounce those ideas off one another on a daily basis and it is a joint effort. Any change in that dynamic would make our work virtually impossible. The problem is … our team leader. We regard him as management in that he sorts rotas and is in charge, so we don’t engage that personally with him. But he is very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up those bright ideas. All we know of his personal life is from social media. He details every tick and comma on Facebook and Twitter (although he has made it plain to us that going on to social media at work is a no-no!). We know when he’s been for a coffee, had the painters in, what the patio is looking like, how the grass is growing, if his football team has scored and if the cat’s had a funny turn. OK over a pint in the pub: but it is all getting too close to work for comfort. First we’ve had the Twitter digs obviously aimed at us. He seems oblivious that we’re reading them but most crucially we fear some of our clients might be, too. It could reflect very badly that a member of staff is dissing the company in public.

      "Louis van Gaal: Manchester United fans were right to boo at Southampton loss Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester United’s fans were right to boo him during Saturday’s 1-0 home defeat to Southampton in the first sign of open revolt since the Dutchman arrived as manager at Old Trafford but refused to say whether he fears for his job. Charlie Austin’s 87th-minute header on his debut for the visitors consigned United to a first defeat in six games. It widened the gap to Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place to five points after the London club’s 3-1 win at Crystal Palace. It also posed questions about Van Gaal’s position. “I cannot answer. It is not for me to answer these kinds of questions,” said Van Gaal. Supporters jeered the side during another insipid United display. At the final whistle they booed Van Gaal loudly as he walked to the tunnel. “You cannot say that they [fans] are not right,” he said. “They are right and of course they are disappointed and they have the right to boo me. You know it was not good today. It was a poor game and we could not create chances and our opponent also had a few chances. So it’s more or less a 0-0 game. But at the end we have lost.” Asked if this was the poorest display of a tenure that began in summer 2014, Van Gaal said: “I don’t know but it was a poor performance because football is not only defending but also creating chances and we didn’t create any chances. Our opponent denied that so it was a poor game for the fans. I can imagine that.I am disappointed but I have to think and already I put the question how I can change this because we have to change this. That is my job and it is not an easy job at the moment. Nevertheless we have won three times in 2016 and a draw so very good results in January – but we could not show it in this game. I did not see that confidence today.” Van Gaal does not believe the transfer window can change things. “One player cannot change everything. Sometimes it looks like it but it is always the process of team-building what makes a team stronger but sometimes one individual can give the first stimulus for that process but it is not so easy as you say or ask.” Matteo Darmian became the latest defender to be ruled out when suffering a suspected injured rib in the second half. Van Gaal said: “He was spitting blood on the pitch so he has already gone to the hospital and we have to wait and see what happens. That is the fifth full-back who has been injured so that is what I have to do also to make solutions to solve the problems. Probably one rib and also the chest is something wrong but we have to wait and see.”\n",
      "Openreach decision is an upgrade for all – as long as Ofcom gets sums right Has Sharon White at Ofcom flunked it by declining to order an immediate breakup of BT? No. The argument for liberating Openreach – as advocated by Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk – was always too full of wishful thinking. There are many reasons to bemoan BT’s performance in broadband but abolishing one monopoly supplier to create another monopoly supplier would have achieved little in itself. An independent Openreach, loaded with a chunk of pension liabilities, might have chosen to sweat its old copper assets just as intensely as critics say BT does. Competition would not have been advanced one jot. Even more heavier-handed regulation might have been required to improve the UK’s broadband infrastructure. White is sensibly retaining the breakup option and thus waving a weapon at BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to discourage foot-dragging. But, for now, the focus is on encouraging rivals to invest in competing fibre cables while injecting accountability into Openreach. It is a good, pragmatic choice. First, BT will have to allow rivals to build their own fibre networks by opening up Openreach’s underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. Second, there will be heavier fines if Openreach misses service standards. Third, Openreach will have an independent board. The opening up of the infrastructure is the most important innovation. BT reacted by shrugging its shoulders and saying rivals have had that right since 2009 and few have bothered to use it. Ofcom counters that life will be different in future: fibre enthusiasts will enjoy easy access and lower costs and be allowed to make decent returns. Much depends on the regulator getting its sums right. But, if it has, there is the chance of a proper contest, to the benefit of consumers. Sky will no longer have to grumble that BT is wedding everyone to a “slow lane” copper-based future. It will be able to exploit its rival’s lack of vision by betting on ultrafast fibre and scooping the winnings. Go for it. Ofcom’s other two main prescriptions for Openreach will have to pass a real-world test. Penalties advertised as “substantial” must bite. And the new arm’s-length governance set-up – a separate board and investment budget – must avoid the endless wrangling seen in the banking sector over ringfencing. But Ofcom’s basic thinking is correct. More competition for Openreach, not a messy divorce from BT, sounds a quicker way to upgrade the country’s broadband. Paying dividend pays dividend for Lloyds bosses It’s easy to look pretty in today’s banking sector. All you have to do, it seems, is pay a dividend that investors can believe in. It worked for Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday as a £2bn distribution to shareholders was greeted with a 13% surge in the share price. The market’s excitement was odd because Lloyds did little more than it had previously pledged on dividends. Perhaps investors were worried that the Bank of England, at the 11th hour and amid the Brexit brouhaha, would insist that more capital should be retained. As it is, Lloyds’ 2.25p-a-share ordinary dividend (ignoring the 0.5p special) offers a yield of 3.2%. Not bad by recent standards, but there was nothing in Lloyds’ actual trading figures for 2015 to indicate old-fashioned growth. Pre-tax profits actually fell 7% to £1.64bn, dragged down by yet another thumping provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Net income was virtually flat. And boss António Horta-Osório said he won’t achieve his desired cost-to-income ratio until the end of 2019, about two years later than planned. One of the culprits for the latter was “the lower for longer interest rate environment”. That’s not going away soon. PPI provisions will, Lloyds hopes, but the lending climate in the UK looks downright dull. Even at Lloyds’ preferred “underlying” level – in other words, ignoring the nasties – profits were only up 5% to £8.1bn. That was in a good year for the UK economy; the weather could turn rougher. On the bright side, there are worse prospects than dull market leadership, especially when it is endorsed by a disgracefully tame competition regulator. The alternative investment choices for bank investors are litigation hell (HSBC), investment banking befuddlement (Barclays) or a bag of uncertainties (Royal Bank of Scotland). There is a separate question of whether Horta-Osório and colleagues, now that they have taken Lloyds out of the emergency ward, still need to be paid danger money.

Rather than increase the pressure on the leaders, Manuel Pellegrini’s side performed like men who should worry about being overtaken by West Ham or Manchester United in the top four. The would-be champions have not won back-to-back league games for five months and have a difficult run-in on top of a Champions League campaign that they aim to extend by seeing off Dynamo Kyiv in midweek. Norwich, meanwhile, can take heart from a point won with a spirited performance and their first clean sheet in more than two months. It could prove a springboard to survival. Manchester City have grown accustomed to beating Norwich heavily in recent seasons, including a 3-0 win here in the FA Cup in January, but this time, when only victory would have fuelled belief that they can topple the league leaders, they lacked creativity and sharpness. Norwich initially seemed there for the taking but emerged as deserving recipients of a point. The hosts’ jitters, caused by a 10-match winless streak, served as an invitation to the visitors to make themselves at home again. Pellegrini’s team hogged the ball but did not have the ingenuity to do much with it and were at times expensively sluggish. When Russell Martin headed an attempted clearance on to Sergio Agüero in the fifth minute, the Argentina striker gave him enough time to recover and block the ensuing shot. And when Fernandinho produced a rare incisive pass in the 21st minute to put Gaël Clichy clean through, the left-back miscontrolled and let the ball run out of play. By that stage, all that the home goalkeeper, John Ruddy, had done was awkwardly push a 20-yard free-kick by Agüero over the bar. Not until the 29th minute did Ruddy have to excel, plunging quickly to his right to tip away a low drive from Agüero with one hand. City could not make him perform such a feat again. That shot came against the run of play because Norwich, encouraged by the visitors’ impotence, had started to apply pressure at the other end. With Martin Olsson supplying regular crosses from the left, the Carrow Road crowd began to belt out hopeful chants. Patrick Bamford nearly brought ecstatic roars in the 39th minute when he outwitted Nicolás Otamendi and hit a half-volley over Joe Hart from 30 yards. There were exasperated yelps all round when the ball cannoned out off the crossbar. By first-half stoppage time, when Matt Jarvis shot just wide from 16 yards, the title-chasers were a slovenly bunch. David Silva flitted about purposefully but lacked zest and too few of his team-mates were on his wavelength in the first half. Wilfried Bony, again picked ahead of Kelechi Iheanacho, exerted no influence before being replaced by Raheem Sterling in the 58th minute. In the middle, there was a Yaya Touré-shaped hole. The Ivorian has his flaws but boasts a creative menace that none of his team-mates provided in his absence. Manchester City started the second half with renewed urgency. That made Norwich defend with renewed nervousness, but no less commitment. Gary O’Neil and Jonny Howson were tirelessly vigilant in front of the back four. The visitors failed to penetrate. Just after the hour Silva, playing more centrally following Sterling’s introduction, spotted a run by Fernandinho and rewarded it with a beautiful pass. But the Brazilian eschewed a straightforward shot and offloaded to Agüero, who bumbled before his shot was blocked. Agüero sought to make amends moments later with a jagged run towards the box. Timm Klose took him down just outside, and the free-kick yielded nothing. “We had a very good attitude and very good possession but we couldn’t create the space that we needed in the last third,” said Pellegrini, who insisted his team could still be champions. “If you mathematically have a chance to do it, you must always think you can do it.” Neil remains convinced that Norwich will get out of trouble. “The amount of effort the players are putting in to stay in the league can’t be questioned and our game management and our decision making was better than in recent weeks,” said the Scot, whose team will soon host the two sides closest to them in the table, Sunderland and a Newcastle United side whose illustrious new manager holds no fear for Neil. “Rafael Benítez isn’t going to win the game for them, it’s all about the players,” said the Scotsman.\n",
      "Rafael Benítez exudes belief Newcastle can avoid relegation Rafael Benítez says he finds mind games boring but the worrying thing for Sam Allardyce and Alex Neil is that, right now, he has no need to resort to them. Underpinned by a famously forensic eye for detail, the Spaniard’s aura of calm, good-natured authority is transforming Newcastle United to the point where supporters of Allardyce’s Sunderland and Neil’s Norwich City are becoming unsettled. By simply being himself, Benítez has not only galvanised his own team but planted seeds of doubt in the minds of both rivals. A combination of the Spaniard’s grace under pressure and Newcastle’s best Premier League run since 2014 has fuelled real hope on Tyneside that a team one and two points, respectively, ahead of the other contenders for the last two relegation spots can stay out of the bottom three. Considering Norwich and Sunderland have a game in hand, the odds remain against St James’ Park staging top-tier football next season but Benítez retains the air of an experienced pilot quietly confident he can safely accomplish a high-risk landing on an icy runway buffeted by crosswinds. “It’s not 100% in our hands,” acknowledged Newcastle’s manager, who knows he needs another win at Aston Villa on Saturday. “But we’re going in the right direction, we’re doing the right things, we’re enjoying this challenge and we’ll try and enjoy it until the end.” The fragility of such pleasure was emphasised by the nervous undercurrents rippling through a capacity crowd before the excellent Andros Townsend sent a sublime free-kick curving into the top corner. Indeed the tension would surely have become unbearable had Karl Darlow not subsequently dived low to his left and saved a Yohan Cabaye penalty that threatened to offer Crystal Palace a point. It was typical of Benítez that, when Rob Elliot ruptured his cruciate ligament and joined the similarly injured Tim Krul in the treatment room, he refused to panic, instead simply stating how lucky Newcastle were to have such a good third-choice goalkeeper. Judging by Darlow’s occasional, generally unconvincing, appearances under previous managers it seemed wishful thinking but, instead, the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper has been little short of brilliant. Granted his positioning and footwork may be a bit unorthodox at times but he has pulled off a series of fabulous saves – on Saturday he repelled a difficult volley from Palace’s dangerous Yannick Bolasie and an awkward Cabaye shot – as his team-mates have reacquainted themselves with the concept of hope. “This is a big three points for us,” said Darlow, who was shocked to see the penalty awarded for what seemed a nonexistent handball against Moussa Sissoko. If it helped that Cabaye, widely booed by his once adoring former geordie public, struck his kick poorly, Darlow still performed heroics. “I just picked the way to go, dived hard and reacted to the ball,” he said, reflecting on a stop which could yet prove worth £100m to Newcastle. “It was possibly the most valuable save I’ve made. It was one of those special moments that could keep us up. We do our research and look through everyone’s penalties before we play them and Cabaye had put his last four or five the other way. So it was just instinct.” Had fortune not frowned on Krul and Elliot, Darlow knows he would not even be warming the bench now so he appreciated it was imperative to take his unexpected chance. “I never had any doubt I could play at this level,” he said. “I just needed an opportunity but now I have to help make sure we stay up.” With Bolasie and Cabaye causing them all sorts of problems Newcastle did not start too well but, gradually, a series of players apparently reborn under Benítez came to the fore. While Jamaal Lascelles highlighted his authority at centre-half with a fine, goal-preventing tackle on Connor Wickham, Cheik Tioté made some important interceptions and the impressive Jack Colback began really imposing himself on central midfield. When Townsend’s magnificent free kick arced over the wall, safety felt within reach. “It wasn’t an easy game,” said Benítez. “When you see the size of Crystal Palace’s players you realise that, physically, they’re stronger than us so we couldn’t win by just fighting. We had to play football and when we started to move the ball on the floor you could see the difference.” It was all so absorbing that, rather than proving provocatively divisive, Alan Pardew’s presence on his first return to the club since leaving for Palace seemed almost irrelevant. “Alan was braced for a hostile one,” said his assistant, Keith Millen. “But there was nothing. Newcastle fans realised they had bigger things to worry about.” Man of the match Karl Darlow (Newcastle United)\n",
      "Swansea 1-0 Aston Villa: Premier League – as it happened Gomis drills fractionally wide from 25 yards, a fine effort. Moments later the final whistle goes, and Swansea have surely ensured they will be in this league next season. Villa played well at times, particularly in the first half, but they were toothless in attack. Thanks for your company, goodnight! 90 min There are four minutes of added time. In the first of those, Britton is booked for a brazenly cynical foul on Agbonlahor. 89 min Lescott is booked for stopping a Swansea break with a tug on Gomis. 87 min “Had a short It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia break, and let’s see what’s happening,” says Michael Rosefield. “Ah. I could probably squeeze another episode in.” Everything’s fine. 83 min “Commiserations for having to ogle the odyssey of misery that is Swansea v Villa,” says Keeley Moss. “Not having anything as sophisticated as Sky Sports, BT Sport or any other televisual means of football-viewing, I’m a third of the way through the May 2002 episode of Crimewatch UK. Which come to think of it, is probably where Villa ought to be shown given their frankly criminal defending this term.” 82 min Swansea are as comfortable as at any stage in the match. After an excellent first half, Villa are now playing like Villa. 78 min Villa are having a good spell, although it would be stretching it to say they look like scoring. The youngster Green has been good since coming on. Meanwhile, Swansea bring on Kyle Naughton for the impressive Modou Barrow. 77 min “With tonight’s match as further proof, I’d submit that this Villa team is the worst in the history of the Premier League,” says Alan Gomes. “Not just the worst Villa team, which it obviously is. The very worst team in two decades of Premier League history. Even worse than that post bankrupcy Pompey affair. Tim Sherwood, take a bow!” Never forget. 75 min Villa’s fans appeal for handball when Cissokho’s cross hits a Swansea defender. 74 min A Villa substitution: Gabby Agbonlahor replaces Carles Gil. 72 min Green runs at Rangel and wins a corner for Villa. Fernandez heads it behind for a second corner, which Gil swings onto the head of Lescott. He sees it late and heads straight at Fabianski from 10 yards. That’s the third shot on target in this match. 68 min Sigurdsson, already booked, brings Hutton down. It wasn’t enough for a second yellow. I bet Mike Dean was tempted, though. 67 min “Shame you have to watch this filth,” weeps Paul Jaines. “To show my solidarity I am sitting in in front of an open fire sipping a beautiful aged Bordeaux and eating French cheese. I may open a Burgundy next.” I’ll be opening some claret with a sharp pencil in a minute. 66 min A corner to Villa, conceded by Williams. Gil swings it in from the right, and the inevitable Williams heads it clear. He is a brilliant defender. 65 min “I’ve watched Villa all season and that’s got to be the worst goal conceded by any team,” says Thomas Darnton. “Guzan should have easily got there. He has made too many mistakes this season and I think that Remi Garde should give Mark Bunn another go because we then won’t concede shabby goals like that.” Cutting out those cheap goals could be the difference between finishing 20th and, er, eh. 62 min Fer nutmegs Lescott in the box but then picks the wrong option. Swansea are in control now. 62 min A Villa substitution: the 17-year-old Andre Green replaces Veretout. 61 min “To be honest it’s difficult ... ” begins Malcolm Tucker Mark Turner. “...to muster a comment and help you out in your onerous task. After a week of wonderful Cheltenham (just watched Sprinter Sacre on YouTube again...spine-tingling), then the amazing Leicester bagging another three points in a tight nail-biter we’re served as dessert...Swansea versus Aston Villa and the home team take the obvious lead after a first half of utter drudge. Sports reporting for the brave, we salute you Mister Rob.” 60 min Sigurdsson is booked for a bad tackle on a Villa player whose name must be withheld for legal reasons I didn’t catch. 58 min Remi Garde slumps back in his chair with the rueul look of a man who bought a collector’s edition DVD of 8 1/2 on eBay and has just opened the parcel to find a cassette tape of 9 1/2 Weeks. 57 min “Not watching it either,” says Michael Rosefield. “I find Villa games are best enjoyed with eyes closed, head in hands, rocking yourself back-and-forth and telling yourself everything’s fine.” That email came before the goal. This one came after. “EVERYTHING’S FINE, EVERYTHING’S FINE, EVERYTHING’S FINE.” What a scruffy goal. That foul by Cissokho led to a free-kick for Swansea 40 yards out. It was curled into the corridor of uncertainty by Sigurdsson, which tempted Guzan off his line. He got there late and flapped it onto Fernandez, who was looking the other way when the ball hit him and rebounded gently into the net. 52 min Cissokho, on a yellow card, trips the dangerous Barrow. It looks like a second yellow card, but Mike Dean instead decides to give Cissokho a final warning. I want to marry Mike Dean. 51 min “How do you see the relegation battle going, especially Benitez is in charge of Newcastle?” says Shaun Wilkinson. “Will he make the difference? I would suggest that whoever loses the derby tomorrow is going down with the Villa.” Relegation battles are relatively hard to predict. There have been some thoroughly improbable escapes in the last decade – West Ham, Fulham, Wigan, Portsmouth – so I wouldn’t be surprised if any of them apart from Villa stayed up. And that’s the expertise for which you all love the . (I think Newcastle and Norwich will go.) 50 min “I am here, I have money on Siggy,” says Paul E. “Not even watching, just reading you.” I’m sorry. 48 min Barrow makes another no-frills run infield, opening up the play. Then he shifts it to Sigurdsson, who breaks towards the area before Lescott makes an important interception. 47 min Anyone out there? Please, please, please don’t make me do another 45 minutes of this on my own. 46 min Swansea begin the second half. They have brought ball-retention specialist Leon Britton on for Ki. The match has lived down to expectations so far. Villa should be ahead, but they aren’t. See you in 10 minutes! 42 min A terrific cross from Gueye is half cleared to Gestede, who loops an overhead kick towards goal from 12 yards. Fabianski had it covered but Williams headed it away for a corner to be on the safe side. From the corner, Clark heads over from 10 yards, a decent chance. 40 min Williams makes an excellent sliding challenge on the right of the area to deny Ayew, and the ball deflects back off Ayew for a goalkick. Why did none of the big clubs buy Williams when he was in his prime? 38 min Barrow runs at Cissokho but then plays a poor pass to Ki on the edge of the box. He is a threat with his speed though. Gomis then screams a long-range shot high and wide. 35 min Rangel gets into the box on the right and picks out Sigurdsson, whose first-time shot is blocked by Clark. 33 min Veretout’s flat cross is met with a powerful flicked header from Gestede, 15 yards out. Fabianski plunges to his left to make a comfortable save. 32 min Sigurdsson plays a fine through ball to Barrow, who is just offside. Not that it mattered, because he over-ran the ball when he went round Guzan. He has been Swansea’s biggest threat though. He is comically fast. 31 min With every passing minute of Villa superiority, it becomes ever more obvious that Swansea will win 1-0 with a 94th-minute own goal from Alan Hutton. 29 min Sigurdsson curls the free kick high and wide. 27 min Gomis finds Barrow, who zooms forward before being hoofed up in the air by Cissokho. That’s a clear yellow card and a free-kick to Swansea 30 yards from goal. 24 min Sigurdsson’s dangerous inswinging free-kick from the left is headed behind for a corner by Lescott with Guzan flailing at fresh air. 21 min Villa get a corner on the right. Veretout swings it out to the near post, where Clark rises and flicks a header just over the bar from six yards. He should probably have scored. 20 min A long throw from Hutton almost breaks to Ayew in the six-yard box, and eventually it’s scrambled clear. 19 min Kingsley’s mishit clearance hits the raised hand of Williams, but he knew precisely nothing about it and a penalty would have been harsh. I bet Mike Dean was tempted though. 18 min Gueye’s fierce low shot from 25 yards is blocked. Villa have been by far the better team. 16 min Gestede and Williams square up after an impromptu wrestle, and then a few of the other players join in. Mike Dean doesn’t book either player. Williams shoved Gestede in the face, which might warrant a retrospective ban the way things are these days. 13 min Barrow’s driven cross is put behind for a corner by Clark at the near post. Sigurdsson takes the corner from the right, and the stooping Cork heads wide of the near post. It wasn’t any kind of chance. 8 min Ayew misses a good chance for Villa. Cork lost the ball in a dangerous position, allowing Ayew to run towards goal. He slipped smoothly past Williams on the edge of the box but then walloped his shot over the bar. 7 min “There was this as well when Villa were challenging for the title,” says Niall Mullen. “United were on the cusp of greatness. 23 years ago. Twenty three.” 6 min Villa have started confidently and are playing some good stuff. 3 min Fer dithers and unwittingly gives the ball to Lescott, who drills a snapshot wide from the edge of the area. 2 min “Your preamble made me wonder: would Villa somehow staying up rival Leicester winning the league for story of the season?” says Alex Hanton. “Or are there no events in English football that could rival it? Maybe if Flamini invents time travel and Arsenal replace Gunnersaurus with an actual cloned velociraptor?” I’m not even sure Leicester winning the league can live up to the thought of Leicester winning the league. It’s the greatest football story of our generation, at the very least. 1 min Peep peep! We’re off. Some happier memories for Villa fans “You beauuuuuty!” And this, an epic League Cup semi-final. Swansea (4-3-3) Fabianski, Rangel, Williams, Fernandez, Kingsley; Fer, Cork, Ki; Barrow, Gomis, Sigurdsson. Subs: Amat, Britton, Paloschi, Nordfeldt, Routledge, Montero, Naughton. Aston Villa (4-2-3-1) Guzan; Hutton, Clark, Lescott, Cissokho; Westwood, Gana; Gil, Veretout, Ayew; Gestede. Subs: Okore, Bacuna, Sinclair, Agbonlahor, Sanchez, Green, Bunn. Referee Mike Dean (Wirral) Hello. Forgive me for speaking frankly, but the love child of Don King and Barry Hearn would struggle to hype this match. It’s not without significance, however. Villa are down, barring the Mother Teresa of great escapes, but Swansea aren’t quite safe. They have a tough run-in after today, and if results go against them they could be a precarious five points clear of safety by tomorrow. Then again, if they win at home to Villa – and, really, they will need to take a very long look in a very long mirror if they don’t – they will surely be immune from relegation. Kick off is at 5.30pm.\n",
      "Everton 3-1 Middlesbrough: Premier League – as it happened Everton go back to second in the table, having taken 13 points from their first five games. It’s their best start since 1978-79. They respond impressively to Maarten Stekelenburg’s own goal and were comfortable winners, with Gareth Barry scoring on his 600th Premier League appearance. Thanks for your company; night. 90+1 min A nice touch from Ronald Koeman, who substitutes Gareth Barry so that he can get an ovation from the crowd. Tom Cleverley replaces him. 90 min There will be two minutes of added formality. 88 min Everton play a bit of keep-ball to amuse themselves. They look a good side, and so much more solid than last season. 86 min “I want 3000 words by Monday on Everton and Liverpool being top dogs in the league once more, just like back in the day before wireless meant anything other than a radio,” writes my owner Ian Copestake. 84 min Middlesbrough make their final substitution, with Adam Clayton replacing Forshaw. 82 min Fischer’s fierce shot from 20 yards is blocked by the stretching Coleman. I think it would have otherwise inconvenienced Stekelenburg. 80 min De Roon’s high cross is punched away under pressure by Stekelenburg, and Downing’s follow-up shot hits a defender. 79 min Idrissa Gueye has had another excellent game for Everton. 77 min Bolasie mavericks past Barragan but then runs into a second defender. 76 min Boro don’t look like getting a corner, never mind scoring. I think they’ll stay up, but if they do it won’t be because of their attack. 74 min “Agree 100% with the mooted Incorrigible Mavericks rule,” says David Hopkins. “All the better if their skills have little practical application. I’m thinking of Ted McMinn dribbling past some hapless fullback, stopping, then doing it once more for a laugh.” 72 min Gerard Deulofeu replaces Kevin Mirallas for Everton. 70 min Both sides have accepted the result, and the match is drifting along increasingly aimlessly. 69 min Another Boro substitution: Viktor Fischer, the former boy wonder, replaces Gaston Ramirez. 66 min Enner Valencia comes on for his Everton debut, replacing the injured Lukaku. It looks like a precautionary substitution rather than anything more serious, although Lukaku has gone straight down the tunnel. 63 min Barkley almost frees Lukaku in the box; eventually the ball pinballs through the keeper Valdes. When Barkley plays like this, with such penetrative simplicity, you can see why so many managers get excited about him. 62 min “I’m not actually watching the game, but glad to see Bolasie involved,” says Matt Dony. “He is possibly the most entertaining player in world football. I mean, he’s obviously not in that ‘top, top player’ bracket, but the sheer unpredictability is worth the entrance fee. In that respect, he reminds me of Luis Garcia in his 2006/7 pomp. The best player in history for 10 minutes of any given match, an absolute liability for the other 80.” Quite. There should be a quota system whereby every team has to include one incorrigible maverick in their XI. If we can clone Adel Taarabt, so much the better. 59 min Middlesbrough bring on David Nugent for Emilio Nsue. 56 min Everton are in total control of the game now, and Barkley draws a good save from Valdes with a stinging low drive. Barkley has been excellent today, possibly the best player on the pitch. 54 min Mirallas’s golden five minutes continues with a dreadful piece of control in the box after fine play from Barkley. 51 min Baines makes a virtue of a dismal pass from Mirallas, winning a corner as a result. It’s headed away by Friend. 50 min Middlesbrough, tactically speaking, weren’t really built with 3-1 deficits in mind. They are a neat, tidy side but they don’t create that many chances. This should be a comfortable second half for Everton. 49 min It looks like the third goal has been given to Lukaku. I’m not sure he touched it, mind. 46 min Peep peep! Everton begin the second half, and as things stand this will be their best start to a season since 1978-79. Half-time reading aka ‘I think it was me who said...’ After a slow start, that was an enjoyable half of football. The worst thing Middlesbrough did was take the lead, because it woke Everton and the crowd up. See you soon for the second half. 45+2 min Gareth Barry is booked for a foul on Ramirez. Bolasie’s inswinging cross from the right drifts past everyone and into the net. Lukaku claimed it but I don’t think he got a touch. Valdes appealed that Lukaku was offside but replays showed he was fine. Seamus Coleman gives Everton the lead with a fine solo goal. He received Gueye’s pass just outside the area on the right, burst past a couple of defenders and finished calmly into the bottom corner with his left foot. 40 min Barrajan loafs forward promisingly, only to get giddy and hoof one miles over the bar from 25 yards. 36 min Barkley beats Ayala with a beautiful flicked nutmeg, a bit like Robbie Fowler on Steve Staunton when he scored that famous goal against Aston Villa in 1996, and then runs into the box before hitting a shot that is well blocked by a combination of Gibson and the recovering Ayala. When the ball went dead Ayala was booked for attempting to pull Barkley back after he had been turned. 34 min “You’re right about the Middlesbrough goal looking like Andy Gray’s goal at Wembley in 1984,” says Gary Naylor. “If we’re playing the same rules as 32 years ago, I look forward to plenty of tackles from behind, a few professional fouls and a shinpad-splitting challenge or two. No cards though. And a title for us next year.” 32 min A fine effort from Bolaise, who thumps a 15-yard header onto the roof of the net from Baines’s hanging cross. 28 min Barkley ruins an excellent run by blazing over the bar when Lukaku was in a better position. 26 min “Pretty sure Andy Gray never played in a World Cup final,” says Richie Segal, making a very fair point. What the hell was I thinking there? 25 min Middlesbrough might also be aggrieved with the goal against them, because Williams challenged Valdes with his studs showing. Howard Webb says it was a probably a free-kick, and he’ll be thrilled to know I agree with him. Gareth Barry equalises for Everton. On today of all days. A corner from the left rebounded across the box, and Barry half-volleyed it calmly into the top of the net. That’s an excellent finish actually, and a rare goal to mark his 600th Premier League appearance. 23 min The BT commentators - Steve McManaman, Glenn Hoddle and Howard Webb - all think it was a fair goal. I’m not so sure. Stekelenburg was a bit weak but I’m not sure Negredo didn’t foul him. Everton are not happy with this, and there are echoes of Andy Gray’s goal in the 1984 World Cup final. Downing hung up a deep cross towards the far post, where Stekelenburg was in the process of catching it when Negredo powered through and headed the ball into the net. Actually, I think it’s an own goal because Negredo seemed to knock Stekelenburg’s arm, which knocked the ball out of his hands and into the net. 20 min Mirallas comes inside from the left and drills a low shot that is comfortably held by Valdes. Everton have stirred after a sluggish start. 19 min A good effort from Barkley, who moves away from Forshaw and hits a wobbling left-footed shot from 25 yards that is beaten away by Valdes. 17 min It would be silly to jump to conclusions after four and a bit games, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do: Boro won’t go down this season. They look a really good, organised side. 15 min Barry, on his 600th Premier League appearance, is robbed in a dangerous area but Ramirez. He moves straight for goal but Coleman makes a good tackle on the edge of the area. 13 min Everton win their first corner, to be taken by Mirallas on the right. Jagielka mistimes his jump at the near post and shoulders it over the bar. 12 min Here’s Hubert O’Hearn. “Koeman’s knack of almost instantly shaping a club into an attractive and downright scary side, no matter what players he loses, reminds me of a wonderful line about Jack Nicklaus and his clubs (golf variety): ‘He can play with his and beat you, or he can take yours and still beat you.’” 10 min There’s not a huge amount happening right now. 6 min The overlapping Friend is fouled by Coleman on the left wing. Actually, it looks quite a soft free-kick on second glance. Ramirez curls the free-kick towards the near post, where Downing flicks a header across the face of goal and wide. Ayala almost got to it at the far post. 5 min It’s been a confident start from Boro in what sounds like a very muted atmosphere, though that might just be that somebody has pressed the wrong button in the BT bunker. 1 min Peep peep! Middlesbrough, in red, kick off from left to right. Everton are in blue. “Reid’s cross - GRAY!” If you’re an Everton fan, with a fondness for the years 1984 and 1985, this book is definitely for you. It’s published by deCoubertin, who have a cracking collection of Everton books in particular. Everton (4-2-3-1) Stekelenburg; Coleman, Williams, Jagielka, Baines; Gueye, Barry; Mirallas, Barkley, Bolasie; Lukaku. Substitutes: Joel, Deulofeu, Lennon, Cleverley, Valencia, Funes Mori, Holgate.

Kevin de Bruyne is Pep’s Michael Laudrup, discuss Hello. Sometimes, a player’s weakness becomes his strength as a manager: think of George Graham and Glenn Hoddle, swaggering midfielders and magnificent defensive coaches, or hard-faced centre-back Tony Mowbray preaching tiki-taka in the Midlands. Ronald Koeman and Aitor Karanka, whose Everton and Middlesbrough sides meet at Goodison Park today, took their playing strengths with them when they went into management: both were defenders (well, nominally in Koeman’s case) and both know exactly what to do with a bank of four. Both teams are not without attacking flair, but defence will be the key to whether their achieve their ambitions this season. Middlesbrough will be happy to stay up; Everton, who are currently the closest of the also-rans to the champions Manchester City, are aiming for Europe. Kick off is at 5.30pm. Rob will be here shortly. In the meantime, why not have a read of Andy Hunter on how Ronald Koeman feels the noise more than Martínez and Moyes after his strong start at Everton?\n",
      "David Moyes admits lack of summer recruitment could cost Sunderland dear David Moyes has made it plain that Sunderland will be practically doomed to relegation unless his squad is strengthened significantly in January. “I think we know we’re going to have to improve on what we’ve got to give ourselves a chance,” the manager said, following the 3-2 home defeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday. “Ultimately you have to have good players on the pitch and, at the moment, we’re not getting enough good players on the pitch. We need to get a better team, it’s as simple as that. We need to get a team which can give us results.” This latest setback leaves Moyes with only one point from his first six Premier League games since succeeding Sam Allardyce, and Sunderland bottom of the table. “It’s been a tough period because I wanted to be successful,” Moyes said. “I knew it wasn’t going to be all easy, that’s for sure, but I did expect to find myself winning games. Now, though, we have to try and find a way to get out of it.” Although Moyes acknowledges that a lack of adequate recruitment, not only this summer but in previous years, lies at heart of Sunderland’s problems, he is adamant that his existing players need to assume responsibility for the defensive negligence which, once again, cost them dear as they squandered a 2-0 lead against Palace. This, it seems, is absolutely not the time for tea and sympathy. “I don’t know that I’m necessarily an arm-around-the-shoulder man,” Moyes said. “I want to see men stand up and take responsibility, be tough and take the challenge on. At the moment we’re not doing the basics well enough; not heading it and kicking it when we get the chance or doing the picking up and marking we need to do. “The players need to take responsibility. It can’t always be me leading them by the hand and showing them where they should be and what they should do.” Moyes – who has managed Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad – regarded Palace’s stoppage-time winning goal as a case in point, with an unmarked Christian Benteke heading home a free-kick. “Benteke’s arguably the best header of the ball in the Premier League and nobody got close,” he said. “We gave him a free run and jump.” Despite Sunderland making eight summer signings, they failed to secure the striker Moyes craved to support Jermain Defoe, who scored twice against Palace; they also failed to re-sign Yann M’Vila, the former France midfielder who shone on Wearside last season while on loan from Rubin Kazan, and lost Younès Kaboul, a key defender, to Watford. Before leaving to coach England in mid-July Allardyce had become deeply concerned by the lack of a single signing and Moyes was left playing catch-up. “We’re probably paying the price for not recruiting earlier,” the Scot said. “But what would you say about the year before that or the year before that? Would you say we’re paying the price for recruitment then or are there other reasons?” Jan Kirchhoff shared his manager’s dismay. “A shocking result,” the former Bayern Munich midfielder said. “We led 2-0 but we didn’t all have the same idea about what to do next and we threw it away. “As players we have to take 100% responsibility. We get well prepared before the games. It’s up to us to communicate on the pitch. We need leadership down there, people who are willing to take the lead. We have to get our shape back and have one clear idea of what we’re doing.”\n",
      "Tottenham and Danny Rose punish wasteful Liverpool to claim draw Jürgen Klopp leaned back in his chair, threw a glance to the skies, and wore the expression of a man who had just been told the last bus home had been cancelled. “Oh my God,” he said, exhaling deeply. The information he was trying to take in actually concerned one of the decisive moments of Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham. It was a moment that might have turned one point into an excellent three. With one of their crisp breaks Georginio Wijnaldum slipped the ball to Adam Lallana, who pushed the move onwards and the ball across goal for Sadio Mané to tap in. Up went the official’s flag and the strike was disallowed for a very tight offside. “What can I say?” Klopp said. “It was a wonderful goal, huh? Brilliant play. It happens.” He sounded phlegmatic but looked slightly crestfallen. Despite the positives he can take from a complicated early season cluster of games all away from home, he made no bones about his disappointment that there were no more points on the board to show for it. “We have not the most easy starting programme. Four points from nine is not what I wanted but it’s OK. That’s our platform.” Tottenham’s platform shows five points from nine but in terms of the team’s energy levels and attacking zest there has to be more to come from Mauricio Pochettino’s team. For much of this tussle they toiled, they endeavoured, but clear chances did not come easily. The attacking prowess of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and the newcomer Vincent Janssen is yet to really catch fire this season. Pochettino didn’t seem to mind too much if it’s been a slow burner up until this point. “Last season Harry scored in game 10 and was top scorer. I would sign up again for that,” he smiled. Liverpool had more than enough chances to win, quite apart from the mysterious offside call. From the start the thrust of Mané and trickery of Philippe Coutinho tested Tottenham. They set about the challenge here with swift movement and energy. With half-time approaching, Liverpool were handed a clear opportunity to turn their attacking promise into something concrete with a penalty. The referee Bobby Madley saw Érik Lamela catch Roberto Firmino at the edge of the box and pointed to the spot. It was down to James Milner, who had been filling in unfussily at left-back, to make the difference. He slammed his shot past Michel Vorm. Tottenham needed a response, a shot of energy, of inspiration after the break. But it was Liverpool who restarted with more intent: Wijnaldum scooped over; the impressive Joël Matip skimmed a header off the top of the crossbar. Pochettino’s frustration was growing but he later credited his team’s resolve for summoning enough pressure to equalise. Danny Rose escaped the general congestion and was allowed plenty of space to pick his spot when Eric Dier’s cross was knocked towards him. Rose beat Simon Mignolet at the near post, releasing a wave of pent-up Tottenham angst. “ I am very pleased with the reaction, the effort and character we showed because it wasn’t easy,” assessed Pochettino, who had to rebalance his team when Kyle Walker felt sick. Dier switched effortlessly to right-back, and the attack was rearranged. They could have even won it with Toby Alderweireld’s powerful header, which inspired the agile, twisting, save of the day from Mignolet. The fact it was only one vital stop meant something to Klopp in measuring his team’s progress, as the keeper had been incredibly busy in the same fixture last year. “Simon saved our life last time. Today he had one brilliant save,” Klopp said. Liverpool had late chances to clinch it themselves but it was not to be and the manager preached the possibilities he can see in his team, even if there is more polish to come. “This game showed again what we can do. We were really flexible and offensive and played football, had wonderful moments with passing and direction. I wish we would have won it but we have to accept the point and it’s OK. That’s what we have to show in each game.” Pochettino bade farewell to a large chunk of his players on international duty thankful to have avoided a nasty slip. He feels he is “months” away from having his squad where he wants it to be in order to truly compete. He is not the only manager who has lamented the difficulty in finding a sharp groove after a truncated, post-European Championship pre-season. “This is not a perfect break,” Pochettino says. “All the players involved [in the Euros] go again to the national team. It is difficult because some players are going, some will play, others no. We need maybe a few months to get all in the same level. It’s crazy.” No doubt there is more to come from both Tottenham and Liverpool.\n",
      "Why Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is a better fashion satire than Zoolander 2 March 2015 saw the splashy beginning of Zoolander 2’s relentless buzz-building campaign as stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson appeared in character at Paris fashion week. It was covered extensively by both film and fashion press, and kicked off an exhaustively well-sustained assault on anyone with an internet connection all the way through to its release in February this year. Given the first film’s cult following and how surprisingly well it stands up to repeat viewings 15 years later, expectations were high for another quotable combination of well-measured silliness and sharp fashion-industry satire. But it was a washout, a tiresome and aggressively unfunny mis-step, the sort of lazy rehash that makes you question whether you even liked the original. Five months later and we have another couple of fictional fashionistas dusted off and resurrected for those blessed with a good memory. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie brings back Patsy and Edina, originally on the BBC in 1992, and catapults them to the big screen following in the footsteps of The Inbetweeners and, most recently, Dad’s Army. The campaign was far more modest, cheap even, and the buzz was notably less feverish, not helped by the film’s first press screening taking place just two days before its release. Yet, against all odds, it works. The comic timing of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley has been curiously underutilised in the years since Ab Fab went off air, and the film, wonderfully short, scrappy and snappy at 91 minutes, gives them free rein to remind us of their skills. It’s imperfect (the plot is almost an afterthought), but it’s far funnier than it should be, given how unnecessary it all seemed on paper. The pleasure of watching the pair drunkenly embarrass themselves across Europe far outweighs watching Stiller and Wilson uncover new levels of idiocy in a glossier transatlantic trip. Both films posit their characters as relics, struggling to keep up with an industry changed irrevocably by social media and populated with those far younger and sharper. But Patsy and Edina were always in this mode, obsessed with remaining current, aware of their sell-by date and failing, miserably, to succeed in the fashion world. Alternately, Derek and Hansel were, bizarrely and comically, at the top of their game in the first film, only to be brought back to earth in the sequel. When your film receives a green light on the basis of fan service, you’d be wise to make sure your most loyal fans are well-served. By changing the dynamic, we lost the joke of seeing two middle-aged, above-average-looking men touted as gorgeous supermodels and instead in the sequel, they ended up playing fortysomething dads failing to comprehend selfie culture. Ab Fab doesn’t deviate from its original setup, it merely exaggerates it, an understandable decision given the increased gap between the leads and the youthful culture they hope to dominate. There’s also a confidence in the characters in Ab Fab thanks to a wealth of material, 39 episodes in fact, that have proved their longevity and also the actors’ skill at playing them. Zoolander 2 proved that Derek and Hansel have less mileage, and despite both films having largely nonsensical and haphazard plots, only Patsy and Edina manage to rise above. The poor box office of Stiller’s sequel was a sign that the fandom wasn’t as strong as Paramount had anticipated. On the same budget of $50m, similarly belated comedy follow-up Anchorman 2 managed to make almost four times that, while Zoolander 2 just about broke even. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie won’t play to huge numbers abroad, but surprisingly strong reviews and a fanbase that’s stuck around since the early 90s might make it a modest domestic success. By never pretending to be in style, Patsy and Edina have remained more fashionable than Derek and Hansel could have ever dreamed of.\n",
      "Juan Mata’s mastery may push Wayne Rooney to Manchester United margins Wayne Rooney may now be entering the career phase when he is used only in certain games for Manchester United. This was the unescapable conclusion drawn from José Mourinho’s decision to drop him to the bench and the 4-1 rout of Leicester City at Old Trafford that followed. The victory on Saturday was significant because it reversed the rot of two successive Premier League defeats and to do so Mourinho found the ruthless streak that has been a driving part of his gilded success at Porto, Chelsea (in both spells), Internazionale and Real Madrid. After the EFL Cup win at Northampton Town ended the run of three defeats on the bounce in all competitions – the other came in the Europa League – Mourinho examined what was needed to defeat the champions and decided his captain was surplus to requirements. Instead Zlatan Ibrahimovic retained his place at centre-forward, and Mourinho fielded the pace of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard out wide. The selection of Juan Mata at No10 was of most significance. For the first time since the Spaniard arrived in January 2014 (from Mourinho’s Chelsea) Mata was selected in his favoured position ahead of Rooney, who had to gaze on as United coasted into the break 4-0 ahead. A 20-minute burst that featured goals from Chris Smalling, Mata, Paul Pogba (a maiden United strike) and Rashford – answered only by Demarai Gray’s second-half shot – finished the contest and may have ended Rooney’s days as a certain starter. The Liverpudlian has been written off before – doing so is a quasi-national pastime – but Mourinho’s post-game comments may come to be viewed as the death knell for his alpha-male status in the XI. “We thought the solution for us was to play with the two fast kids and with Mata in a position where he could interact,” the Portuguese said. The subtext here is that Mourinho decided Rooney was the inferior option to Mata to link with Lingard and Rashford. The reason is the side’s previous poor form in which Rooney’s apparent inability to stop wandering out of position clogged United’s flow. Yet Mourinho stressed that Rooney was still his man (as the manager has to) and Smalling believes his England colleague will soon be back in the side. “I think he’s a very experienced guy and he’s played that many games that it’ll only be a matter of time before he’s back in there and firing again because he’s quality,” the defender said. Mourinho talked of how Rooney was the captain not only on the field but away from it with regard to representing the club and helping out team-mates. Smalling concurred. Asked if Rooney had been down about being dropped, he said: “No. He was the same as [ever] before the game when we’re all getting ready. He is often one of the most vocal and he was the same. “Regardless of whatever the situation is, whatever game, whether he is on the bench or playing or whatever, he is always that same type of character and that’s why he is England’s main man and our main man.” But for how much longer? United’s next outing is the visit of Ukraine’s Zarya Lugansk on Thursday evening for the second Europa League group match. Rooney may well be recalled for a game that must be won following the defeat at Feyenoord in the opener. This, though, may establish a pattern of the forward being deployed sparingly by Mourinho and in contests against lesser opponents. If Rooney was discarded for the challenge of Leicester what about when, say, United travel to Liverpool (the next league game but one) or are at Chelsea the following weekend? The victory against Leicester has given Mourinho a mandate – for the foreseeable future, at least – to leave out Rooney when he wishes. A reverse to Claudio Ranieri’s side or even a less emphatic win may have provoked the question of whether Rooney is a convenient scapegoat. Not now. For the time being the man with 246 United goals (three behind Sir Bobby Charlton’s record) may be reduced to a peripheral role. Smalling said Rooney had been vocal in the dressing room before the match despite starting on the bench. “He had the same method,” the 26-year-old said. “Even when there’s games – obviously we play League Cup and he [Mourinho] changes the whole team, he’s still the same, in the changing room talking. That’s something that will never change with Wayne.” The defender revealed what Mourinho’s message was beforehand. “He really wanted to get that factor over of enjoyment and enjoying it because he there’s 70-odd thousand people in the stands who would want to be in our shoes and his shoes,” he said. “It’s just a case of realising how lucky we are. And you can see that everyone did enjoy it so that message really did get across.” How much personal satisfaction Rooney drew from not being a factor in the victory is moot. He may not have been hurdling the moon to witness the side function so well without him. Afterwards Rooney, who came on for Rashford with seven minutes remaining, had a kickabout with his children on the pitch. The question is how soon he will again be mixing it regularly with the big boys.\n",
      "Sunderland suffer with Virgil van Dijk grabbing Southampton a point Following an unseemly few days for Sunderland off the pitch, it was back to the football and time for the club’s players to provide some on-field respite. They did so up to a point, weathering a literal and metaphorical storm before taking a late lead courtesy of a Jermain Defoe strike shortly after Southampton had been reduced to 10 men. Unable to hang on, they let Virgil van Dijk rescue a point for his side three minutes into added time. This was two points dropped rather than one gained for Sunderland, but at a ground where they suffered the humiliation of losing 8-0 last season, it was revenge of sorts and defeats elsewhere for fellow relegation battlers Newcastle United and Norwich City made it a little sweeter. Or did they? “It was a kick in the teeth,” said Sam Allardyce. “I can’t even begin to tell you how dejected we are and how much more difficult we’ve made our job to stay in the Premier League.” Asked if he could see any positives from the point gained, his answer was emphatic. “No,” he sighed wistfully. “I was looking forward to celebrating my first clean sheet on Mother’s Day, but now I think I’ll be crying into my glass of wine and I hope I don’t take this out on my grandkids.” In an opening half hour memorable mainly for the bitterness of the south coast cold, neither side created much to warm the cockles. After 22 minutes Fabio Borini, in at the expense of Defoe, escaped down the right only for his low, angled drive to be blocked by an excellent covering tackle from Van Djik. Soon after, Southampton ought to have gone ahead, only to be foiled by an excellent Vito Mannone save after Dusan Tadic had reacted quickly to power a Graziano Pellè knockdown goalwards. Just after the half hour, Mannone’s opposite number was called into something resembling urgent action. With a Wahbi Khazri free-kick from wide threatening to drift in to the top left-hand corner, a furiously back-pedalling Fraser Forster did well to palm the goal-bound effort on to his crossbar. In splendid isolation out on the wing, Khazri clasped his head with both hands in sheer frustration. The cold of the first half was augmented by torrential rain early in the second, although the deluge failed to dampen the enthusiasm of a vocal visiting support. As the downpour eased off, Jack Rodwell had them out of their seats but his low effort failed to trouble Forster unduly. Rising to the spirit of tit-for-tat in which much of the game was played, Oriol Romeu promptly sent the ball fizzing inches over from 20-yards. As the game entered its final 20 minutes, Sunderland sat deep on the back foot but it was Southampton’s José Fonte who was forced into an act of desperation. The Portuguese earned a straight red card for grappling Borini as he chased a through ball to the edge of the penalty area. From the subsequent free-kick, Patrick van Aanholt brought a very smart stop from Forster. Enter Defoe. Lamine Koné pounced on a knockdown from Jan Kirchhoff in the penalty area, evaded a tackle and squared for the substitute to prod home from seven yards and prompt scenes of unbridled jubilation in the away end. They were short-lived, however: Southampton huffed and puffed relentlessly before eventually blowing the Sunderland house down when the excellent Van Dijk found himself unmarked on the end of a cross into the Sunderland penalty area and fired home deep in injury time. “It’s strange that we play our best football in the last five or six minutes,” said Ronald Koeman. “From the beginning we need better performances football wise but we showed great character after going 1-0 down and I’m very pleased with that.” Slumped in a chair at his post-match press conference, his opposite number could scarcely have sounded more glum.\n",
      "Race review – reverential middle-of-the-pack drama More marathon than sprint, Stephen Hopkins’ period biopic affords the Jesse Owens story – one of the greatest eff-yous ever recorded in competitive sport – a reverential, middle-of-the-pack treatment: stumbling exposition, grandstanding performers, a thousand yards of rousing speeches and music cues. It’s regrettably typical that Stephan James’s Owens is given a caucasian interlocutor in coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis, reining in the smirks), and that his personal struggles are partially obscured by the negotiations of diplomat Jeremy Irons with a chilly Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat) and saucy Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten). Still, it raises its game – as drama, spectacle and camp – the closer it gets to the Olympic stadium, where Hitler awaits, muttering darkly in the stands like a Voldemort in epaulettes. That it remains broadly watchable owes much to James’s lean, committed turn, but what’s around him often seems to be carving its lightning-bolt history into not stone but easily digestible cheese.\n",
      "Saving a new mother from death almost made me quit as a nurse Sometimes women bleed after having a baby, I was told in my orientation sessions. Some blood loss is normal, they said, but may require quick action and medication. Sometimes it’s predictable, like with fast or long labours when the uterus gets overworked. At its worst, it can be like someone forgetting to turn off the garden hose. They were right. It was the end of a 12-hour night shift. Although I had more than five years experience as a nurse, I had only worked in labour and delivery for a year, just long enough to know I had a lot to learn. I crept back into the quiet, dark delivery room after my break. My patient’s epidural was effective and she was sleeping through her contractions while her husband napped in the corner. I realised that the induced contractions on the monitor were coming too fast. This can either cause stress for the baby or tire out a uterus. In this case, the baby was fine but mum’s uterus was getting tired. The baby’s heart rate looked good on the monitor and things progressed quickly. The family doctor, who rarely did deliveries any more, flew in just in time to catch the baby. One more minute and I would have delivered her. Then the steady pour began. Big baby, third baby, fast labour, too many contractions – a lethal combination. Like a runner at the end of a sprint, the mother’s uterus just gave up. The room filled with doctors. I was part of the resuscitation team. We started IVs, hung blood, gave medication. A senior nurse came in to assist. My natural inclination was to turn it over to her experienced hand, but she said: “You’ve got this, I’m here if you need me.” I have never felt so empowered. All my worries that I would freeze under stress were eradicated. The adrenalin was like a camera focusing a lens. I knew what to do, and how to do it. I watched as the colour drained from the patient’s face and she began to lose consciousness. When I readied her for the operating room, I realised if she died, the last thing she would have seen was my face as I took her healthy baby out of her arms to be fed by another nurse. After documenting everything in a record to show we had done what we could, I stopped in the car park to dry heave. The superwoman feeling was gone, exhaustion and shock in its place. Then the dread set in. I realised I could do this, but did I want to? I was scared that the next time my patient might not live. I knew all nurses have the potential to lose a patient but in that moment, it became real to me. I could be the difference between life and death. I had a scheduled week off and the further away from the situation I got, the more I didn’t think I could return. I spent the days at home with my family and began to doubt my abilities. I had called to find out that, although the patient had lost her uterus, we had saved her life. In the end, practicality won out. If I didn’t go back what would I do? I have children to feed and a mortgage to pay. I didn’t see an alternative but to face my fear head on. My heart rate increased when I received my next assignment. My patient was having her fourth baby; it was big and she had a history of bleeding heavily after delivery. All the things that put her at risk of bleeding again. Checking the board, I realised the same obstetrician was also on duty. The patient had a challenging delivery and in the end she did bleed, but I was ready for it. I massaged her uterus and gave the drugs I had the week before. This time, they worked and the bleeding stopped. Somehow, the universe knew this repeat haemorrhage was exactly what I needed. I chose to believe the voices in my head saying I couldn’t handle this job were wrong. The second haemorrhage wasn’t as bad as the first, but the feeling of panic was gone. Despite hoping mums don’t haemorrhage, I realised that it is a privilege to be a nurse with the skills, the medication, and the team to treat them if they do. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. I didn’t have to watch in desperation as my patients bled to death like so many nurses and midwives do. I live in a country where I have the privilege of being part of a team that has the resources to fight back. Without doing what I do, in a different place or time, these patients wouldn’t survive. Here, in Canada, I have the chance to save them. If you would like to write a piece for Blood, sweat and tears, read our guidelines and get in touch by emailing healthcare@theguardian.com.

      "Brain implant helps paralysed man regain partial control of his hand A 24-year-old man who was paralysed in an accident six years ago has regained some control of his hand using an implant that sends signals from his brain directly to the muscles that move his wrist and fingers. Known as a neural bypass, the implant allows Ian Burkhart to swipe a credit card, play the video game, Guitar Hero, and perform actions such as picking up a bottle and pouring the contents, holding a phone to his ear, and stirring a cup. He is the first person to benefit from the technology. Burkhart, from Dublin, Ohio, was on a beach holiday to celebrate the end of his first year in college when he dived into a wave that dumped him onto a hidden sandbar. He was 19, extremely independent, and had never considered that such an accident might strike him down. The force of the impact snapped Burkhart’s neck at the C5 level. He could still move his arms to some extent, but his hands and legs were useless. Friends pulled him out of the water and raised the alarm. By chance, an off-duty fireman was on the beach and called paramedics. Burkhart had therapy for the injury with a team of doctors at Ohio State University. From the start, he was hopeful that advances in medical technology would improve his quality of life. He told the team he was interested in research and willing to take part in trials of new technologies. The Ohio researchers got their hands on a neural bypass developed by a charity called Battelle and offered Burkhart the chance to have the implant fitted. “That was the million dollar question: do you want to have brain surgery or something that may not benefit you. There are a lot of risks,” said Burkhart. “It was certainly something I had to consider for quite some time. But after a meeting with all the team and everyone involved, I knew I was in good hands.” He went ahead and surgeons duly fitted a tiny computer chip into the motor cortex of his brain. Here, the chip picked up electrical signals from the part of the motor cortex that controls hand movements. The fuzz of brain activity is fed into a computer and converted into electrical pulses that bypass the injured spinal cord and connect to a sleeve that Burkhart wears on his forearm. From there, 130 electrodes send the pulses through the skin to the muscles beneath, where they control wrist and even separate finger movements. The patterns of the signals are tuned to produce the movements Burkhart thinks about making. It took time to learn how to use the device. Over 15 months, Burkhart spent up to three sessions a week learning how to control his hand movements. “Initially we’d do a short session and I’d feel mentally fatigued and exhausted, like I’d been in a six or seven hour exam. For 19 years of my life I took it for granted: I think and my fingers move. But with more and more practise it became much easier. It’s second nature.” “The first time I moved my hand, I had that flicker of hope knowing that this is something that’s working, I will be able to use my hand again. Right now, it’s only in a clinical setting, but with enough people working on it, and enough attention, it can be something I can use outside of the hospital, at my home and outside my home, and really improve the quality of my life,” he said. Burkhart performed the first movements using thoughts alone in 2014, but has since learned more complex actions and more precise control over his hand and fingers. Details of the latest results are published in Nature. “It was an amazing moment for the team,” said Ali Rezai, a neurosurgeon at Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center, recalling Burkhart’s first hand movements. But at the time, his control allowed for only basic movements. “A few seconds after the amazement, we said OK, we have much more work to do here.” The team set to work on turning the rough movements into precise, useful actions. Chad Bouton, who helped create the device, said the study marked the first time a person living with paralysis had regained movement using signals recorded from within the brain. “We think this is an important result as we try and pave the way for other patients in the future, not only those with spinal injuries, but also those that have experienced a stroke, and potentially even traumatic brain injury,” he said. “We were not sure if this would be possible,” Bouton added. “Not only were we able to find those signals in the brain and decipher them for individual finger movements, but we were able to link those signals to Ian’s muscles and allow that kind of movement to be regained. This is important for daily activities, such as feeding, and having the patient be able to clothe themselves.” The researchers are now looking at a host of improvements that should make the system more portable and possible to use outside the hospital. Brain signals picked up by the implant could potentially be sent wirelessly to the computer for processing, and onwards to the forearm sleeve to stimulate the muscles. Another improvement could see more electrodes added to the brain chip, so more subtle signals can be detected and passed on to the patient’s muscles. “Ten years ago we couldn’t do this. Imagine what we can do in another 10,” said Rezai. Nick Annetta, an electrical engineer on the team, said the team was working to make the system smaller and useful for a broader range of patients. “This could be applied to other motor impairments, not just spinal cord injuries,” he said. “We think this is just the beginning.”\n",
      "La Liga president attracted by Champions League breakaway The president of Spain’s La Liga has admitted he is considering proposals to form a breakaway competition to rival the Champions League because it represents a “greater opportunity to generate more revenue”. In July, the Dalian Wanda Group – which is owned by China’s richest man Wang Jianlin – revealed it had begun discussions with clubs to create a new tournament which would rival the current competition run by Uefa. Speaking to the Financial Times on Friday, Javier Tebas, who has been president of the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional since 2013, admitted that while no agreement had been reached, Spain’s leading clubs could be attracted by the idea in the wake of new bumper TV deals for their counterparts in England and Germany. “If [European club competition] is reorganised as Wanda has set out, there is a greater opportunity to generate more revenue from audiovisual broadcasting,” he said. Last week, Uefa announced that Europe’s top four leagues will have four automatic places in the Champions League group stage from the 2018-19 season onwards – a move that was supported by clubs in Spain and Italy. However, Tebas was critical of the changes and said they had made it more likely they could support a breakaway because key issues such as the more even distribution of broadcasting funds have not been addressed. “We’ve also become more interested in [Wanda’s] proposal since Uefa announced they will be reforming [the Champions League], without seriously consulting — in detail — their broader reform plans with the other national leagues,” he said. “With our strategy, we will even overtake the Premier League in terms of international deals. Therefore, both Spanish and English football fans will be pleased, as they will both get the chance to watch their games across the world. So long as Uefa does not destroy our business.” Wanda, which already owns a 20% stake in last year’s beaten Champions league finalists Atlético Madrid, paid $1.2bn last year for Infront Media, the Swiss company led by Philippe Blatter - the nephew of former Fifa president Sepp Blatter. The FT reports says they have been leading negotiations for a new tournament, with proposals including merging the Champions League and Europa League into one competition. “The idea of unifying the two tournaments is not a bad one,” said Tebas. “But what is clear is we have to work something out with all the different national leagues and Uefa is not doing it.”\n",
      "Mark Schwarzer: Leicester City's non-playing Premier League lucky charm Leicester City’s title victory has lent some weight to the theory that veteran Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer is a Premier League lucky charm. While the former Socceroos goalkeeper did not play a single league match for the Foxes this season, he became the first player to be involved in back-to-back title victories with separate clubs in the Premier League era. He is also the oldest player, at 43, to be in a Premier League title-winning squad. Schwarzer, who was with Chelsea last season before moving to Leicester in January 2015, does not meet the official criteria to qualify for a winner’s medal, which stipulate a player must have made at least five appearances to receive one. The veteran did not play a league match during Chelsea’s title run last year either, yet he still pocketed a medal after then-Blues manager Jose Mourinho decided to buy him a replica in recognition of his efforts from the bench. Schwarzer played numerous cup matches for both sides in the two-year period and is highly regarded as a mentor for younger goalkeepers. There has been no indication yet from the victorious Leicester camp as to whether Claudio Ranieri will follow suit this year and make Schwarzer the first player since Eric Cantona (Leeds United-Manchester United in 1992 and 1993) to win back-to-back top flight titles with different clubs. The keeper, who was understudy to Kasper Schmeichel this season, played a role in keeping Leicester in the top flight when he arrived, playing six matches in their run to fight off relegation. Schwarzer, who retired from national duties in 2013, helped the Socceroos end their World Cup finals drought in 2005 when he saved two penalties in a play-off shootout against Uruguay. His European club career included stints at Bradford, Middlesbrough and Fulham, before proving the lucky charm for Chelsea and Leicester. He featured for the Foxes just three times this season, against Bury, West Ham and Hull City in the Capital One Cup.\n",
      "Middlesbrough on the ascent as Gastón Ramírez helps them sink Hull Gastón Ramírez harbours unhappy memories of Hull and will doubtless have enjoyed taking his frustrations out on Mike Phelan’s spirited but under-powered team. Dispatched to Humberside on loan by Southampton two years ago, the Uruguayan struggled with injuries and poor form, and it took a transfer to Teesside to help restore him to former glories. And Ramírez, once again emphasising his importance to Aitor Karanka’s gameplan, headed in a winner to lift Middlesbrough four points clear of the relegation zone and towards mid-table security. It left an unambitious Hull, who restricted a dominant Boro to few clear-cut chances but created next to none of their own, second from bottom and heading into a bitter night with their future as unclear as the fog-shrouded roads leading south to Humberside. “We controlled the game,” said Karanka, for whom it was only a third victory of the season. “It was a really good win, beating Hull was massive. They’re really well organised but we showed we were better than them.” Phelan did not entirely disagree. “We were under severe pressure but I thought we defended well,” the Hull manager said. “With better decision-making we could possibly have got a point.” As the mist began rolling in from the Tees, a cagey opening filled with backwards and sideways passes was briefly enlivened when Álvaro Negredo met Marten de Roon’s lay-off. Twelve yards out, the striker was slackly marked but, perhaps unwisely, he elected to shoot with the outside of his left foot when he seemed to have time to shift it on to the right. Unsurprisingly, the shot arced high over the bar. David Marshall, Hull’s keeper, has one of Víctor Valdés’s old Barcelona jerseys hidden away in his garage. It is a souvenir from the night in 2004 the then youthful Celtic keeper was part of the team who won a Uefa Cup match against Barça, and he seemed minded to perform a few more heroics here. Having reacted well to save Ramírez’s low 25-yard shot and then divert a similar effort from Adam Forshaw, he initially proved adept at it. Boro’s improvement in recent weeks has been largely attributable to Karanka’s installation of his other Barcelona old boy, Adama Traoré, wide on the right, and the winger’s demotion to the bench raised eyebrows. His place was taken by Viktor Fischer, who thought he had scored after turning the ball home following Ramírez’s cross and Negredo’s headed flick only to see the effort rightly disallowed for a combination of offside and handball. No matter; Karanka’s players were very much in control. They appeared almost affronted when Hull finally escaped their half and looked unprepared for Adama Diomandé’s acceleration on to Markus Henriksen’s pass. Then, just as Diomandé, shaped to shoot, Ben Gibson slid in to retrieve the situation with a perfectly timed, brilliantly executed tackle. “Ben Gibson, he’s one of our own,” chorused the Teesside crowd as Steve Gibson, the club’s owner and the centre-half’s uncle, looked on approvingly. Behind the smiles, Gibson Sr might have been a little concerned by Boro’s failure to translate superiority into goals, the moment when Fischer’s inviting delivery struck a startled Negredo on the side of the head seeming symbolic of their attacking travails. Significantly, that was a rare cross from a home player and maybe a few more would not have gone amiss. Possibly this dearth of centres was down to Ramírez being used as much more of a playmaking No10 than a winger. It also had something to do with Fischer’s struggles to get beyond Ahmed Elmohamady but philosophy comes into it too; Karanka wants to play in a more between-the-lines way. On Monday, though, Hull’s five-man midfield made fluency difficult in the freezing air, though the game finally defrosted 15 minutes into a second half full of home dominance when a set piece rescued Boro. Fischer’s corner found Ramírez totally unmarked at the far post and his glancing header defied Marshall. Industry personified, the Uruguayan deserved his moment. Phelan’s side immediately became more expansive after Ryan Mason and Jake Livermore were withdrawn and Tom Huddlestone and the young Jarrod Bowen were introduced. And after Ramírez hobbled off with a minor injury, Hull suddenly prompted panic for Boro. Their new-found sense of adventure resulted in Valdés saving brilliantly from Diomandé in stoppage time. Connecting with Robert Snodgrass’s ensuing corner, the lone striker then poked the ball narrowly wide. Next Valdés directed a clearance straight at Snodgrass but he could not quite take advantage. “We don’t have great resources,” Phelan said. “We know it’s going to be difficult – but this will not kill our sense of belief.”\n",
      "Chelsea v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read Dominic Fifield’s full match report here: That’s the end of an increasingly enjoyable game. Costa and De Gea embrace. Louis van Gaal is giving the fourth official the hairdryer, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear. That Costa goal surely ends United’s title challenge, and De Gea’s wonderful save might end Chelsea’s chance of being in Europe next season. Paradoxically, fans of both sides should be pretty happy tonight, because there was plenty to enjoy in their attacking play. Thanks for your company, goodnight! 90+6 min De Gea makes a brilliant save to win a point for United! Costa rumbled into the box on the left, came inside Smalling and drove a crisp shot towards the near post. It was going in but De Gea got down so smartly to tip it round the corner. 90+5 min Juan Mata is applauded off by both sets of fans as he is replaced by Ander Herrera. 90+4 min A lovely effort from Rooney, who beats Ivanovic on the left of the box and then floats a gentle chip over Courtois and onto the roof of the net. Courtois didn’t look worried, in fairness to him. 90+3 min Chelsea are pushing for a winner. Schneiderlin concedes a free-kick that is woefully overhit by Willian. Fabregas stabbed a straight, short-range pass towards Costa in the area. He was played onside by Borthwick-Jackson, who came across and slid in to challenge as Costa shaped to shoot from eight yards. Borthwick-Jackson got there first, but his sliding tackle only diverted the ball away from the grounded De Gea, and Costa was able to tap the ball into the vacant net with considerable glee. Costa has equalised! 90+1 min Depay wasted a promising break with an almost offensively sloppy pass towards Schneiderlin. 90 min There will be six minutes of added time, a result of the Zouma injury. 89 min Willian curves a free kick to the far post, where Costa gets above Blind but thumps his header over the bar from six yards. He should probably have scored, or at least forced David de Gea into a miracle save. 88 min Alan Smith, on Sky, says United would be deserved winners, and he’ll be thrilled to know that I agree. Apart from the 10 minutes before half time, when they were all over the show, they have controlled the game. They haven’t created that many chances, they never do, but they have had a lot of the ball. Until the last 10 minutes, anyway: apparently Chelsea have had 93 per cent of the possession in that time! Pick that stat out! 87 min “Wow!” says Ezra Finkelstein. “Rooney didn’t score for United.” I know! First time since 2009 I think. 86 min Another United substitution: Memphis replaces the goalscorer Lingard. 85 min United can’t get out of their third, never mind their half. 84 min The corner is a poor one from Willian. But the pressure is building, and Mata fouls Hazard 30 yards from goal out on the left. Another Willian free-kick... is cleared. 83 min Smalling is booked for a deliberate handball, just outside the box to the left. I’m not really sure he could have done anything to get out the way, but never mind. The free-kick is taken by Willian and headed clear by Martial. A few seconds later, Terry wins a corner. 82 min I wonder if Luke Shaw or Borthwick-Jackson can play anywhere else, because this kid is the most promising homegrown United youngster in a long time. His crossing is outstanding and he seems eerily composed for a 19-year-old. 80 min Lingard is booked for being a naughty boy. 79 min “De Gea,” writes Mike Gibbons, whose brilliant book you should buy here. “This is Ronaldo 2008-09, without the histrionics. He’s going to do one, isn’t he? May as well enjoy him while we can.” It’s so easy to get lost in the moment, and think that the best now is the best ever, but I can’t ever recall a goalkeeper with better reflexes than De Gea. 78 min Another good move from United is ruined by an overhit cross from Lingard. Van Gaal makes his first substitution, with Schneiderlin replacing Fellaini. 76 min Mikel leaves his studs on Carrick, who is booed by the Chelsea fans for experiencing consequent pain. Some refs might have sent him off, though it was one-footed – rather than two, like Flamini earlier – and he was probably in control of his body. 74 min Darmian’s low cross comes to Rooney, 14 yards out. His first touch controls it behind him, and as it bounces up he improvises to hook an acrobatic shot – not a volley – that is not far wide of the near post. Courtois had it covered I think. 72 min Another good save from De Gea. Fabregas does really well to slip away from Blind and Borthwick-Jackson on the right side of the area before smashing a rising shot towards the near post. De Gea is sufficiently alert to stretch and push it behind for a corner – from which, Terry’s scuffed shot is cleared off the line by Martial. It might actually have been going wide, I’m not sure; Martial was on the far post anyway. 70 min This is a good spell for Chelsea. Cahill gets in front of Fellaini at the near post, running onto Willian’s right-wing corner, but he mistimes his header and United survive. 68 min A fine save from De Gea keeps out Ivanovic’s brilliant volley. A cross from the right was headed up in the air by Azpilicueta at the far post, and Ivanovic – lurking six yards out to the left of centre like all good right-backs – welted a technically superb left-footed volley towards goal. De Gea demonstrated his peerless reflexes, stretching to tip it over the bar. DDG is indeed dead, dead good. 67 min Guus Hiddink makes his final chance, with Pedro replacing Nemanja Matic. 65 min If the scoreline stays like this, United will move within four points of City, five of Arsenal and Spurs and ten of Leicester. Martial almost makes it two, running clear onto Fellaini’s through pass, but Courtois plays sweeper-keeper to good effect. From the resulting throw, Lingard clatters a bouncing ball not far away from the top corner on the far side. Moments later, Borthwick-Jackson puts it another gorgeous cross but there’s only Rooney in the box. 63 min Blind is booked for shoving Costa over from behind, just outside the box on the right. It was a nice move involving Carrick, Martial, Mata and then Borthwick-Jackson, who fizzed a low cross into the box from the left. It ricocheted to Lingard, who was 12 yards out, facing away from goal and with Azpilicueta behind him. He kept his composure to take a touch and then smash a rising half-volleyed drive on the turn that gave Courtois no chance. That’s a really nice goal. Manchester United take the lead with a fine goal from Jesse Lingard! 59 min Play resumes, with Cahill on for Zouma. “It was Sharpe!” says Scott Wightman. “Sorry. I got lost looking at this picture of Valbuena in action against Belgium the other week. IMHO Sharpe as the 5 is one of the great weird numberings because all of the virtues one traditionally associates with a 5 - physical strength, intense concentration, better without the ball at their feet - were absent from Sharpe’s (considerable) game. Zidane was a 5 but he genuinely could have played anywhere if he wanted to.” 58 min Zouma is being moved very carefully onto a stretcher. I can’t remember the last time I heard a footballer scream as much as that. It brought to mind Syd Lawrence’s sickening injury for England against New Zealand in the 1991-92 Test series, though I should stress that there’s no suggestion Zouma’s injury is as bad as that. (Warning: this clip is definitely not for the sensitive) 55 min Zouma is in trouble here. He’s screaming with pain every couple of seconds, and a stretcher is coming on. He landed awkwardly as he cleared a loose ball, and it doesn’t look good. Gary Cahill will replace him. 54 min A Chelsea substitution: Oscar off, Eden Hazard on. 54 min “All I remember about numbers was that the tiny sticky-backed ones you could buy to attach to the back of Subbuteo players used a glue that consisted of the most unadhesive substance known to mankind at the time,” says Kevin Porter. “I believe its modern application is to coat distressed ice-rinks.” Oh my, I’d forgotten all about those. You could learn everything about the innate cruelty of life just by spending half an hour trying to number your Subbuteo players. 53 min Another chance for United. A cross from the right bounces off Martial, but he gets to the loose ball first and tees it up for Lingard in the D He shapes a curler towards the corner, and Courtois dives a long way to his left to make a fine save. 51 min “I used to love the exoticism of squad numbers when they were confined to international tournaments,” says Martin Gamage. “Take the Holland team at the 1974 World Cup when the keeper, Jan Jongbloed, sported the number 8 shirt. It suggested that even the keeper had the ability to embrace total football, come over all Johnny Rep, and plant a wonderful shot into the opposition’s top corner.” 50 min Two chances for United. First Blind reads the play to pick Costa’s pocket near the halfway line and find Rooney. He comes in from the left and hits a good shot that is beaten away by Courtois, diving low to his right. United almost score moments later when Martial comes infield from the left, easily away from Ivanovic, only to drag a decent chance wide of the near post from 10 yards. 49 min United have started the second half as they did the first, with lots of the ball. 49 min “I detest both teams,” chirps Gene Salorio, “but I find Fellaini’s persistent fouling much more annoying than Costa’s thuggery. The latter is, sometimes, an amusing part of the spectacle. The former is just static.” 48 min Mata’s curving cross from a narrow position finds Rooney in space 12 yards out, but he mistimes his jump and the ball loops into Courtois’ hands. It was an awkward chance because the ball was hit with pace by Mata. 47 min “I think it was Denis Law who first used the phrase ‘Twisted Blood’, in relation to what George Best, on his debut, left Graham Williams of WBA with,” says Mark Power. “Although I’d hate to suggest that SAF allowed an unoriginal thought into his head ...” I thought it was Paddy Crerand? I wasn’t saying Alex (we’re pals) invented it, just that he used it for the first time (to my knowledge) after that 4-1 win at Chelsea in October 1995. 46 min Peep peep! It’s only Ray Parlour’s autobiography the return of our old friend Ryan Dunne! “Re: numbers. I did always find it a tad off that Veron was given David May’s #4 shirt, but it’s amusing to imagine him asking what the previous occupier of the position was like and Fergie giving it the big sell (“aye he was a key part of the Treble success, just look at where the lad’s standing in the photos” etc).” Half-time chit-chat “Is it decided?” says Jeffrey Sisler. “Is Cahill definitely the #3 centreback for Chelsea? I miss his height in the box.” Let me ask Guus and get back to you, I’m meeting him for a Flat White tomorrow. Peep peep! An adequate half of football comes to an end. See you in 10 minutes! 45+1 min Chelsea could have had a penalty there. Willian’s deflected cross came to Terry, 10 yards out. He hooked the bouncing ball towards goal, and it hit the hand of Blind before deflecting wide of the far post. Blind’s hands were up as he threw himself at the ball in the kamikaze/John Terry style, so you can understand why Chelsea were aggrieved. 44 min After a nice move involving Rooney, Mata and Lingard, Darmian sidefoots a diagonal low cross that somehow misses everyone and goes out for a goalkick on the far side. That was a beautiful cross. 43 min Willian finds Costa on the left. He tries to come inside Darmian, who knocks the ball onto Costa and out for a goal-kick. Costa doesn’t dispute the decision. I know. 42 min United have restored order with a bit of tiki-takanaccio. 40 min Oscar does the sour metres, tracking back to concede a corner when Lingard breaks clear on the right. It’s United’s 10th of the half. Blind swings it in and Fellaini, wrestling with Zouma, heads not far wide of the far post from 10 yards. Actually that come off his shoulder, not his abundant noggin. 39 min “On the topic of squad numbers, I hold their introduction into the Premier League as one of the causes of the current state where about a quarter of Anfield empties in protest well before the end of the game, and even Arsene Wenger is advocating splurging forthcoming television millions on players (and their agents and salaries),” says David Wall. “They used to be just an additional treat to decorate international tournaments, but once they became common-place they then had to be followed by names on the back of shirts, for further ease of identification, and then you get the cult of the individual where a player signing a contract extension can be an item on the national television news without further explanation of the context or why it is significant (why anyone other than him and the club should care about his employment conditions). I wonder if a return to 1-11 numbering would roll back the tide.” The only way to roll back the tide is to put the internet back in its box. We all know it, we just don’t know how to do it. Also: WAS IT LEE SHARPE? 38 min Diego Costa does his thing, bundling Borthwick-Jackson off and then stomping around with an affronted coupon. 37 min “This really has been a half of two halves,” says Maher Sattar. “That’s all I have.” It’s more than I got. 36 min Chelsea have been superb in the last 10 minutes and could easily have scored three times. 35 min Willian puts Borthwick-Jackson on his backside with a lovely feint and then sidefoots an inviting cross along the six-yard box. Darmian blocks Oscar at the near post and Azpilicueta at the far post can’t get there. 34 min Another chance for Chelsea, this time for Oscar. who picks up a return pass from Fabregas and sidefoots high and wide from a tightish angle, 10 yards out. 33 min “Surely, surely this is a United side that has improved and grown up and moved on from the one that huffed and puffed ineffectively only to be undone by one moment of Eden Hazard magic last season?” says Thabo Mokaleng. “Surely?” Have you been cryogenically frozen for the last nine months? 32 min Costa misses the best chance of the match. It was a neat move from Chelsea, involving Oscar and Willian. Oscar played a penetrative ball down the inside right channel to Costa, who ran away from Blind and then sidefooted a shot just wide of the far post from 15 yards. It wasn’t a sitter, though he probably should have scored. 30 min This is Chelsea’s best spell. Fabregas almost blunders straight through the defence, with the last man Smalling sliding it to challenge him. “Speaking of shirt numbers, do you think Chelsea will retire the no. 26, if Terry is set to leave after the season?” says Konstantin Sauer. “After all, it’s not exactly one of the numbers regarded as ‘legendary’.” I suppose. Might as well. 29 min Ivanovic gives Martial a taste of his own medicine, driving forward to win a corner. It’s swung out towards Matic, whose flicked header at the near post is caught acrobatically by De Gea. It was a comfortable save. “How often is Superjohn Terry going to fiddle with his CAPTAIN’S armband today?” muses Adam Roberts. 28 min For all the unarguable competence of United’s passing, they haven’t created much. Mata has been busy but only Martial looks threatening. 26 min Chelsea get their first corner of the match. It’s swung in and headed over the bar by Costa, who makes a beeline for the referee Mr Michael Oliver to complain about the intrinsic unfairness of being Diego Costa. Blind was leaning on him a but, but, well, no. 24 min “No5,” says David Wall. “It was Mike Phelan, wasn’t it.” He used to wear No5, but I thought that was before squad numbers. Didn’t they come in for the second season of the Premier League? By which time Giggs was around and wearing No11, so Sharpe needed another number. I don’t know. Jeez, this is hot chat. 22 min It was a goal from Ryan Giggs on this ground that first leg Sir Alex Ferguson to use the phrase “twisted blood”. Another United left winger, Martial, is starting to twist Ivanovic’s blood. He wins another corner, which leads to another corner, which leads to a third. Blind takes it and it so nearly falls to Fellaini six yards out. But it doesn’t, so let’s move on. 21 min Martial’s dangerous inswinging cross towards the abundant noggin of Fellaini is superbly defender by Terry (I think). 20 min It could be a long afternoon of the soul for Ivanovic against Martial, who looks the most dangerous player on the pitch. 18 min That’s a lovely save from Courtois. Martial moved infield from the left, ignored Ivanovic and then, from the corner of the box, smashed a fierce right-footed shot towards the far top corner. Courtois stretched high to his left to tip it round for a corner. 17 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Seeing as people seem to be asking questions in their emails today, riddle me this. Who do you reckon will be managing these two clubs in the corresponding fixture next season?” Mourinho and Simeone. You have my word. 16 min A wonderful, Gascoigne-like surge through the heart of midfield from Willian eventually leads to Oscar hitting a fierce 20-yard shot that is well blocked. That was Chelsea’s best/only attack so far. 15 min “In the squad number era (better name than the Premier League era if you ask me),” begins Scott Wightman, “Bruce was United’s original 4 and Pallister the 6, but who was the original 5? Clue: it’s not Ronny Johnsen.” Was it Sharpe? 14 min “If I remember, didn’t Liverpool start the decline of proper numbering by putting the slight and nippy Craig Johnston in the 5 shirt, in the days when it was the preserve of large chaps who looked like they snacked on housebricks?” asks Simon Cherry. Don’t forget Argentina 1978, who numbered their World Cup squad in the hipster style. 13 min A crisp low shot from Carrick, 25 yards out, is well held by Courtois down to his left. 12 min Mata and Rooney work the ball nicely to release Borthwick-Jackson, whose cross is blocked for a corner by Ivanovic. Borthwick-Jackson has started really well. Blind’s corner is headed clear to Rooney, who completely mishits a volley from 30 yards. 10 min Another corner to United down the right. Blind takes it short to Darmian, whose cross is headed out for a throw-in by Terry. United are all over Chelsea. 9 min United have started so well that you feel sure they are going to lose 1-0 despite having 68 per cent possession. 8 min The corner is cleared to Borthwick-Jackson, who drills a low 30-yarder straight at Courtois. An easy save. 7 min Another corner for United, who are the dominant side at the moment. Blind swings it in from the right and Costa slices it behind for another corner. 6 min “What club did Manchester United buy Darmain from?” asks Dacre. “Also how much did they pay for him?” Torino, £12.7m; oh and you should definitely wear the pink tie. 5 min Meanwhile, in Naples. 4 min United have started like the home side, with some confident passing. Lingard finds Fellaini in a good position down the right; his low cross towards Rooney is inadequate, but moments later a better cross from Borthwick-Jackson is headed behind for a corner by Zouma. The corner is played short, to no great effect. 3 min “Re: Tom Harp’s email,” begins Harry Tuttle. “I‘m always a little disappointed to see No6 in midfield and No4 stuck in defence, if I’m honest.” All we can ask is that you be honest. 2 min A decent early attack from United ends with Matic blocking Lingard and allowing the ball to run through to Courtois. 1 min Chelsea, in blue, kick off from right to left. United are in red. The players emerge from the tunnel, with John Terry feeling the love of Stamford Bridge. This, of course, will be his last game against Manchester United before he signs a one-year contract extension. An email “Some trivia for you. Scottish FA Cup, East Kilbride vs Celtic, latest 0-1 (HT),” says Tom Harp. “East Kilbride line up with players wearing shirts 1 to 11. Playing formation 1-4-5-1. Goalkeeper is #1, defenders #2-5, centre-forward #9, midfielders the balance. When is the last time you saw that?” It’s so funny you should say this, because yesterday my Saturday-league team played a 2-3-5-1 with the goalkeepers wearing #1-2, the defenders #3-5 and so on. Guus Hiddink and Louis van Gaal are chatting away on Sky. Here are the points of interest from their pre-match interviews: Arsenal moved up to third with a 2-0 win at Bournemouth. That means Manchester City are now fourth, and United are seven points off a Champions League place, for a couple of hours at least. Both sides are unchanged, so Eden Hazard stays on the Chelsea bench. You just haven’t earned it yet, baby.

This is where Twitter really comes into its own From the archive A typically brilliant piece from Scott Murray, including George Best managing to score at the Stretford End despite being the victim of a hit-and-run. In the 1.30pm kick off, Arsenal are leading 2-0 at Bournemouth. Get the latest news with Nick Ames’ MBM. Hello and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League contest between the teams in 13th and fifth place, also known as Chelsea versus Manchester United. It’s been an odd time for both clubs, a lost season while Jose Mourinho does the necessary to get what he really, really wants. Chelsea are unbeaten in 12 games since Mourinho was sacked in December. United are on a celebrated unbeaten run of their own – two matches, in which they have scored six goals, some of them beautiful. If they win today they will be able to rationalise that they are back in the title race. Not that it will be easy for them to do so. In the 1980s and 1990s this fixture was almost an away banker. Since 1999, however, United have won three and lost 11 of their last 20 games at Stamford Bridge. That’s not all that has changed about this fixture. For much of the last decade it was a title decider, and in one case a Champions League final; now it’s almost a mid-table clash. Kick off is at 4pm.\n",
      "Everton see off Middlesbrough as Barry scores on 600th Premier League game Everton have not always responded well to adversity in the past but there is steel running through the side under Ronald Koeman. They went behind to the most dubious of away goals midway through the first half but simply brushed the injustice aside, recovered within minutes and went on to claim a handsome victory. Everton now sit second in the table and have scored six goals in their last two games, though it must be said Middlesbrough, like Sunderland earlier in the week, do not possess the most resolute of defences. “Our start was not good,” Koeman said. “We needed to be more aggressive with the pressing but we got there in the end and played some great football. We have improved a lot physically and we have brought in players with a lot of energy.” Gareth Barry enjoyed an eventful evening as he made his 600th Premier League appearance, only the third player to record such a milestone after Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard. The Everton vice-captain could have gifted Middlesbrough an opening goal when he lost the ball in front of his own penalty area, and was relieved when Gastón Ramírez proved to be less sharp at shooting than dispossessing opponents. Six minutes later the visitors did take an unexpected lead, and Barry led the posse of Everton players moaning about it. In fairness he probably had a point, Álvaro Negredo’s goal should not have stood. Replays showed the Boro striker headed Maarten Stekelenburg’s arm rather than the ball as the pair tried to claim George Friend’s cross from the left touchline, thus preventing the goalkeeper making a clean catch. Lee Mason did not have the benefit of replays, however, and awarded the goal, presumably on the grounds that Negredo only attacked the ball and did not appear to have committed any obvious foul. One imagines Barry was making the point a little too forcibly that in such situations goalkeepers are normally given the benefit of the doubt. In a way it was refreshing to find a referee unwilling to treat goalkeepers as a protected species, and possibly true that Negredo also deserved the benefit of the doubt, though had the referee had the opportunity to watch a replay he would have been forced to change his mind. If the occasion was turning a little sour Barry lost no time in making amends. A mere three minutes after going behind Everton were level, and it was Barry at the far post who provided the equaliser. Víctor Valdés punched ineffectively at a Kevin Mirallas corner, succeeding only in pushing the ball against Negredo, from whom it fell to Barry to tuck away with a neat finish, though once again there was an element of controversy. Valdés might have dealt with the cross better had not Ashley Williams impeded the goalkeeper by going for the ball with a raised boot. Ross Barkley and Yannick Bolasie both went close for the home side once the scores were level before Everton hit two goals in quick succession to turn round 3-1 in front, a half-time scoreline that little in the previous 45 minutes had suggested. Séamus Coleman scored the first, accepting a short pass from Romelu Lukaku and coolly rounding Daniel Ayala in the Boro area to make his shooting angle easier, then in the final second of added time Lukaku himself added another. At least the striker claimed the goal, in reality it appeared he had merely stretched out a leg to Bolasie’s cross and made negligible contact. Bolasie had just as strong a claim to the goal, though Lukaku could claim with some justification that it was his action that had diverted the attention of the goalkeeper. Barry’s day become even more eventful with a booking at the end of the first half, after an altercation with Ramírez. Boro became the second north-east team in a week to be floored by Everton’s ability to score bursts of goals, and the second half was basically a story of a team full of confidence passing the ball at will around a defence more interested in damage limitation. Barkley was conspicuous in most home attacks after his dressing down at Sunderland, clearly focused on correcting the impression that he gives the ball away too cheaply. There were occasions, in fact, when Barkley might have done better to release the ball a little earlier, though one determined run into the box after an hour brought a good save from Valdés at the foot of his left hand post. “Today was the Ross Barkley we like to see,” Koeman said. “He’s not a young player any more, he needs to take responsibility. I was honest in what I said about him, but players are not stupid, they know when they have not played well.” Barkley would have liked a goal to mark his rehabilitation, yet though always in control, Everton seemed to lose their attacking focus once Lukaku was withdrawn. Enner Valencia made his debut, without managing to decorate it with any contribution of note. “We lost our concentration at the end of the first half but apart from that Everton had to play well to beat us,” Aitor Karanka said. “They are a good side, better than us. I think many teams night have lost that game by five or six goals to one.”\n",
      "Liverpool put six past sorry Aston Villa as home fans turn ire on Lerner Liverpool performed to a backdrop of fans walking out en masse for a second weekend in succession though it was not inflated ticket prices that sparked the exodus this time but the sheer ineptitude of Aston Villa. No easy games in the Premier League? Nonsense. This was a surrender and Liverpool inflicted a St Valentine’s Day massacre from which the division’s bottom club may not recover. A team supposedly fighting for its life rolled over and died at Villa Park. To add insult to injury, the Villa defender and fan Joleon Lescott tweeted a photo of a top-of-the-range Mercedes S63 shortly after the final whistle, later claiming he had done so by accident as “it happened whilst driving and my phone was in my pocket”. The sense it left, however, is that he is detached and uninterested, just like Villa’s defending. Those fans not sent to the exits in despair turned their ire on the owner Randy Lerner in the directors’ box rather than Rémi Garde in the dugout. The French coach looked on helplessly as the nightmare of Villa’s heaviest home defeat since Ted Drake scored all seven of Arsenal’s goals in a 7-1 win here in 1935 unfolded. On the flip side, Liverpool equalled their biggest winning margin away from home in the top flight but Jürgen Klopp had too much respect for his opponents’ suffering to revel in the rout. He could take greater satisfaction from Liverpool demonstrating that, with Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho available, they do have armoury to punish weak defending. Sturridge opened the scoring on his first Premier League start under Klopp, James Milner, Emre Can, Divock Origi, Nathaniel Clyne and Kolo Touré all followed. Six different goalscorers and a multitude of faults for Garde to correct. No spine, no spirit and no quality. There is no way back for Villa on this evidence. Garde admitted: “As a manager that is probably the worst performance I have had. It is a very bad afternoon, a very bad defeat but we don’t have time to complain and moan. We have to be professional until the end. I will find 11 players for the next game who want to fight.” He was hard pressed to find one . The defensive flaws that are ushering a grand club towards the Championship were quickly exposed, and under minimal pressure, as Liverpool established a comfortable lead without truly exerting themselves. The lack of leadership after Sturridge and Milner scored must have worried Garde as much as the feeble resistance that met two punishing crosses from the Liverpool left. Sturridge started the humiliation with a finish made simple by his intelligent movement. Liverpool worked the ball out to Coutinho on the left and when his in-swinging centre dropped between the static Lescott and Aly Cissokho the unmarked striker steered a header inside Mark Bunn’s near post. Lescott berated Cissokho for losing the run of Sturridge. Abdicating responsibility was a feature of the Villa performance. The visitors’ second came gift-wrapped nine minutes later. The cumbersome Jores Okore dispossessed Coutinho before conceding a needless free-kick with a slight push on the Brazilian. Milner swept in the set piece from a similar position to Coutinho’s cross for the opener, Lescott, Okore and Mamadou Sakho leapt to meet it, all three missed and the ball sailed beyond Bunn into the far corner. Villa’s play deteriorated rapidly thereafter with a procession of half-hearted challenges and basic errors enraging the home support. Garde’s team were abysmal. Once Gabriel Agbonlahor departed early in the second half, taking any semblance of attacking intent with him, they threw shambolic into the mix for good measure. Garde claimed Agbonlahor was suffering from vertigo. “Don’t you have to be high up to have that?” came a biting retort in the press conference. Four Liverpool goals in 13 minutes provided an accurate gauge of the calamity that unfolded. Number three arrived courtesy of the pedestrian Micah Richards. The Villa captain was easily dispossessed by Can, who continued his run as the impressive Roberto Firmino drove towards the defence before squaring for the German midfielder who found the bottom corner from 20 yards. Number four arrived from Origi’s first touch after replacing Sturridge. Once again Villa lost possession, this time to Firmino deep inside the Liverpool half. Coutinho swept a glorious pass around Okore where the Belgium international raced forwards before beating Bunn. Two minutes later came number five, Clyne breaking clear of Jordan Veretout inside the area and converting his first league goal for Liverpool at the second attempt. Number six was appalling from a Villa perspective and a moment of sheer joy for Touré. The Liverpool central defender was stood still and unmarked as Jordan Henderson swept a corner over from the right. Touré did not have to move to convert his first goal in five years. Klopp said: “Having six goalscorers – I can’t remember them all now – is perfect for the boys because it is important that they all really feel it is important to work in this way, but it is not a day to sing songs for us. “You have to show respect for Aston Villa, a great club in a difficult situation. We came here and won the game, that’s important for us, but if someone wins 6-0 someone loses 6-0 and that is not nice. It is a good day for us but a hard day for Aston Villa.” Man of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\n",
      "Arsenal v West Brom, Chelsea v Bournemouth: Boxing Day football – as it happened One more post, with one more final score – Plymouth and Wycombe have indeed drawn 3-3 – and one more match report. Bye! They’re into four minutes of stoppage time in Plymouth. Wycombe have equalised! And some more: Here come the match reports: The big game in League Two is still ongoing, and Plymouth lead Wycombe 3-2 with about seven minutes to play. Doncaster have won, and would go top if Wycombe manage to equalise. The live blogs just keep on rolling today: Michael Butler is all over Hull v Manchester City here: Karl Robinson has won the Karl Robinson derby, his current side Charlton having beaten his former side MK Dons 1-0, away from home. Bury haven’t lost! They’ve ended their 12-game losing streak with a goalless draw at Fleetwood! Final scores: all the Premier League games have finished, and there’s not a draw among them: Arsenal, Burnley, Chelsea, Everton, Manchester United and West Ham are the winners! GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 Sunderland (Borini, 90 mins) That’s another beauty! A right-wing cross is headed out to Borini, 23 yards from goal, who chests down and volleys perfectly into the top corner! Lovely! GOAL! Chelsea 3-0 Bournemouth (Pedro, 90 mins) Pedro’s shot from the edge of the area is deflected, and dribbles past a wrong-footed goalkeeper. GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Everton (Lukaku, 90+1 mins) Everton are going to win this one! It’s a long ball out of defence – Barkley I think, booting the ball out of his own penalty area – and Lukaku runs round Morgan, shrugs off his challenge, cuts inside and sidefoots past Schmeichel. This is true. Today’s red card offence was only marginally less terrible. GOAL! Swansea 1-4 West Ham (Carroll, 90 mins) Llorente pulled a goal back a couple of minutes ago, but before I can tell you about that Carroll meets a looping cross from the right with a crashing left-foot volley, and West Ham restore their three-goal cushion. GOAL! Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland (Mkhitaryan, 86 mins) That’s a super finish! He was a yard offside, but we’ll overlook that. It’s a cross from the right wing, and Mkhitaryan sends a flying backheel volley into the far corner! Phwoar! That’s your excuse for watching Match of the Day right there! Lovely, lovely goal. GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 West Brom (Giroud, 86 mins) West Brom hold out until five minutes from the final whistle, but that’s where their luck/organisation/time-wasting ends! GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland (Ibrahimovic, 82 mins) That’s nicely done. With the visitors overcommitted in attack Pogba carries the ball at an understaffed defence, plays in Ibrahimovic and he waits for the keeper to commit himself before curling just inside the far post. GOAL! Burnley 1-0 Middlesbrough (Gray, 81 mins) A Victor Valdes howler! Heaton hoists forward a free kick deep inside Burnley’s half, Vokes flicks on, and Gray sends in a low first-time shot from the edge of the area. It should have been saved, and it looked like it had been – only for Valdes to let the ball dribble out of his arms and just inside the post! Cameo of the day: former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford, who came on for Preston against Leeds in the 66th minute, and was sent off for kicking someone in the face a little under three minutes later. It was his first appearance since 3 December, when he was sent off against Preston. GOAL! Swansea 0-3 West Ham (Antonio, 78 mins) A tap-in for Antonio, who is all alone in the penalty area when a wayward long-range shot flies to his feet, and he pokes it into the net. “If you offered Pulis 38 nil-nils at the start of the season he’d take your hand off,” says Sean Doyle. He remains on course for one this afternoon, and – pertinently – the game is currently being delayed while an obviously not-seriously-hurt Baggie receives treatment. Great chance for Bournemouth! Wilshere, who’s been superb, plays in Afobe, but instead of chipping the keeper, or shooting wide to his right, the shot is low and too close to Courtois, who saves. Reading have taken a 2-1 lead against Norwich in the Championship. Norwich have also had Jonny Howson sent off, conceding a penalty which is Panenkaed into the crossbar, bounces down and is lashed in by Garath McCleary. Twenty minutes to play, an for someone to give the world a genuinely compelling reason to spend their Boxing Day evening watching Match of the Day. Leicester have also made use of their substitutes: Mahrez and Ulloa have just come on, and the latter had a half-decent chance to score with his first touch, but Robles catches his header. Henrik Mkhitaryan is back: José Mourinho has just brought him on, to replace Jesse Lingard. Oooh! Victor Moses has a shot from just outside the penalty area, but it fizzes just wide of the post. “I’m not having this post-truth world we are entering and will fight for facts at every opportunity,” counters JR. “It is absolutely no herring of any colour to say that the Baggies under Pulis engage in an absurd amount of time wasting. It is a fact that anyone who watches them play knows, and I say this as a Baggies fan.” I believe JR: if there’s a way of defunnifying football, Pulis will probably encourage his teams to do it. GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Everton (Mirallas, 51 mins) Everton, who haven’t won away since September – and that was at Sunderland, who were basically a vending machine for points at the time, so doesn’t really count – are winning away! GOAL! Swansea 0-2 West Ham (Reid, 50 mins) Bob Bradley’s Swans go two goals down, as Winston Reid heads in a Payet corner at the near post. GOAL! Swansea 0-2 West Ham (Reid, 50 mins) Payet’s corner is headed in by Reid at the near post, and Swansea are two goals down. GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth (Hazard, 49 mins) Hazard, who is on his way to another man of the match award (Wilshere having been the key competition in the first half), rolls in the league leaders’ second goal. Chelsea have a penalty! Hazard wins it, and will take it. Plymouth are now 2-1 up against Wycombe, where they’re only just in first-half stoppage time. Meanwhile this, from Charles Antaki: “I’ve not seen the latest David Attenborough series, but if the producers were looking for 45 minutes of an octopus – not a very creative octopus – pummelling away at a jellyfish, they could use footage from the first half of Arsenal-WBA. Not great telly, but nature is after all sometimes dull.” “To be fair to Arsenal fans: I live in N5, I’m not from London and I’m at the Emirates on the boss’s Club Level seats as I normally go to the Etihad,” writes Alex Sargent. “Point is, this isn’t a part of London that sees people coming back for Christmas, it’s one where people aren’t here. Most of my Arsenal ticket-holding friends are elsewhere visiting in-laws and can’t get here. So, in my view, it’s not as apathetic as the Mirror man thinks. Oh and WBA certainly here for nil each.” “How do you know they’re secondary socks? Perhaps they’re tertiary, or even quaternary,” writes Stephen Colwill. This is true. Slimani could be wearing any number of socks. The battle of the bottom two in the Championship seems settled before the break: Rotherham have just gone 3-0 up against Wigan. This from the Mirror’s man at Arsenal suggests it’s a theme: Our man in Leicester is not feeling entertained. “Time wasting by West Brom is a blue and white striped herring,” writes Roy Allen as the players at the Emirates go in for half-time with the score at 0-0. “We all know what Pulis is going to do: he’s going to play a narrow back four with wingbacks as fullbacks and three midfielders in front. A back nine. That’s what’s happening. Arsenal have to do more than faff around in front of them. They need to play at pace, play vertical passes, take risks, take people on. Endless square passes in front of Pulis’s masses ain’t going to cut it. It just makes bus-parking easy.” GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland (Blind, 39 mins) Just recovering from a minor technical issue, so I can’t tell you much about this goal other than that it happened a few minutes ago, and was apparently good. From a short free-kick Burnley’s Boyd slams a piledriver goalwards, but it’s pushed away. In the big game in League Two, it’s now Plymouth 1-1 Wycombe. Jordan Slew has scored the goal. “About 30 minutes in and West Brom are looking in imperious time wasting form,” writes JR, who is watching the action from Arsenal. “Dawson and Foster in particular are dominating possession averaging about 15 seconds at every dead ball. Yacob has chipped in by sitting down with a pretend injury. Neil Swarbrick doesn’t seem to care so the Baggies may have a chance at really shortening the game and escaping with a 0-0.” Sock change! Islam Slimani calls on the physio, his problem eventually solved by him taking off his socks, revealing the fact that he was wearing more socks under his socks, and then donning a new pair of secondary socks over those socks. Bournemouth are playing well at Stamford Bridge, though. Jack Wilshere just went close, and a penalty appeal, following Matic’s challenge on Smith, has been turned down. Eden Hazard Rabona alert! The ball rolls to the Belgian 20 yards from goal and he sends a 20-yard rabona towards the top corner! It’s tipped round the post, and the whistle had already gone for a Bournemouth free-kick, but still. It’s going with form rather than league position at Plymouth, where Wycombe have taken the lead. GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Bournemouth (Pedro, 23 mins) From a short corner, the ball is back alone the edge of the area, then inside a bit, and finally nudged to Pedro on the edge of the area, who half-turns and shoots left-footed over Boruc and into the corner! At the other end, Lamine Kone fouls Mata inside the penalty area, but the referee waves play on. It’s a decent shot, from Van Aanholt, but De Gea saves. And Daley Blind has just been booked for hauling him back, giving Sunderland a decent shooting chance from the set piece. Anichebe has recovered, and played on for Sunderland. That’s Ayew’s first goal of the season. The venue might not be a coincidence: Alexis Sánchez lashes a shot wide for Arsenal from just outside the penalty area. “Ozil under scrutiny (again) today,” writes Charles Antaki. “One slightly irritating thing which does’t help his case is his tendency, when losing a tackle, to seem to be more interested in drawing the referee’s attention to some infringement rather than, y’know, chasing after the ball and trying to win it back.” GOAL! Swansea 0-1 West Ham (Ayew, 13 mins) A long, high cross into the box, a good knock-fown from Andy Carroll, a bit of a howler from Fabianski and a tap-in for Ayew. Now that’s an interesting question. Whatever, it’s not been an enormously popular protest: At Old Trafford, Victor Anichebe is receiving treatment to his left shoulder and looks in some discomfort. That could be the end of his afternoon. Arsenal have had a shot, but Xhaka’s effort from 25 yards sails well wide. I’m keeping an eye on all the Premier League games, which is another way of saying that I can’t really watch any of them, but for now I’ll concentrate on the games at Arsenal and Chelsea. I haven’t seen any chances so far, there or anywhere else. Except at Plymouth, where kick-off has been delayed by 15 minutes because if excessive queues. Peeeep! And they’re off! There are lots of players emerging from lots of tunnels. Action imminent. He thus becomes the only person in Leicester who looks less like Jamie Vardy than he normally does. The Boxing Day effect is a curious one. Watford, for example, haven’t won on Boxing Day since 1986*. That’s statistically implausible. Middlesbrough enjoy this time of year a little better. Doremus Schafer writes to inform me that the correct stat is that Watford haven’t won a top flight game on Boxing Day since 1986, which is no surprise at all. David Moyes does a very brief pre-match interview, as he’s asked if he’s enjoying his first managerial return to Old Trafford since he was booted out by Manchester United: I’ll tell you after the game if it was nice, but it’s always a great stadium to come to. It’s always going to be a tough game. Great tradition, great history. We know José’s team will be hard to play. Mahrez and Drinkwater are on the bench, at least: Remarkable scenes: Not content with giving away Jamie Vardy masks, Leicester have also been handing out mince pies! Here’s a news story on those Jamie Vardy masks: Olivier Giroud starts a league game for Arsenal for the first time this season. Leicester love giving their fans stuff. Last time I saw them they all got blue and white stripey hats, compared to which their Christmas present is a bit of a let-down. I’ll put all the top-flight teams in here. If there are any other line-ups you want, let me know and I’ll do my best. Arsenal v West Brom Arsenal: Cech, Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin, Xhaka, Sanchez, Ozil, Iwobi, Giroud.

The team news is starting to trickle in now, and Manchester United have left Wayne Rooney out of their matchday squad. Some pre-match music, while we wait for the team news to roll in: four great tracks from 2016 (well, I like them anyway): Hello world! So, here we are then. Ye Tradionale Boxing Daye Fixtures, and so many questions to be answered. Principally: who’s been at the sherry? Who ate all the mince pies? Has the stadium DJ put away his festive Shakin’ Stevens records yet, or will you be subjected to one more spin? An afternoon of skill, drama, and goodwill to all men so long as they’re wearing the right colours awaits. Here, to kick things off, are this afternoon’s English Football League fixtures. And in the meantime, hello! Premier League Arsenal v West Brom Burnley v Middlesbrough Chelsea v AFC Bournemouth Leicester v Everton Man Utd v Sunderland Swansea v West Ham Hull v Man City (5.15pm) Championship Look out for: Neither Newcastle nor Brighton are in action this afternoon, so it’s all about the play-off positions, with the visit of Norwich to third-place Reading probably the pick. The bottom two, Rotherham and Wigan, face each other at the New York Stadium. Aston Villa v Burton A Barnsley v Blackburn Huddersfield v Nottm Forest Ipswich v Fulham Preston v Leeds Reading v Norwich Rotherham v Wigan Wolves v Bristol City Newcastle v Sheff Wed (7.45pm) League One Look out for: Karl Robinson returns to MK Dons, his six-year managership having ended “by mutual consent” in October. He’s already managed Charlton against them twice in the FA Cup. And on the subject of reuinions, Bradford City reject Josh Morris returns to his former employers in Scunthorpe colours, as the division’s top scorer. Bury head to Fleetwood having won none of 36 available points since September (at the end of that month they had won five in a row; they have now lost their last 12) Bolton v Shrewsbury Bradford City v Scunthorpe Bristol Rovers v Coventry Fleetwood v Bury MK Dons v Charlton Millwall v Swindon Oxford Utd v Northampton Peterborough v Gillingham Port Vale v Walsall Rochdale v Chesterfield Sheff Utd v Oldham League Two Look out for: Plymouth may be top of the table but their form isn’t great – they have won three and lost three of their last six league games – which isn’t something you could say of their opponents today: Wycombe have won their last six, and haven’t been beaten in the league for more than two months. With their two closest rivals both playing teams in the bottom half and out of form (albeit away from home) there could be new leaders today. Cheltenham v Barnet Crewe v Carlisle Grimsby v Accrington Hartlepool v Blackpool Luton v Colchester Mansfield v Morecambe Newport v Portsmouth Notts County v Doncaster Plymouth v Wycombe Stevenage v Cambridge Yeovil v Exeter Simon will be here soon.\n",
      "Will Finding Dory buck Hollywood's summer of sequel discontent? It all began with Allegiant, the third film in the Divergent series that made a star out of Shailene Woodley and a solid profit for studio Lionsgate, that was thought to have another Hunger Games-type YA franchise on its hands. The teen-skewing action pic opened in March. The previous two entries in the series were hits, causing the industry to think it could give Disney’s surprise smash Zootopia a run for its money. Instead Allegiant flamed out, coming in well behind the animated comedy, despite Zootopia being in theaters for close to a month. In the end, Woodley’s star power failed to overcome the bad reviews it received: Allegiant only grossed $110.6m worldwide (including a paltry $66.1m domestically), coming in well behind what its two preceding films made, and forcing Lionsgate’s stock to slide dramatically. The poor showing raised questions about the commercial viability of the upcoming fourth and final film in the Divergent franchise. It’s unlikely, however, that Hollywood could have predicted at the time that Allegiant’s disappointing performance portended bad things to come for the majority of tentpole sequels that would soon follow in its wake. Since Allegiant bombed, studios have watched in horror as sequels, expected to perform stronger than their predecessors, came in well behind expectations. “Sequelitis,” a term used by the Hollywood Reporter’s Pamela McClintock in her recent article, Hollywood’s New Problem: Sequels Moviegoers Don’t Want, seems to have taken ahold of audiences. The sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Out of the Shadows, is just the latest summer blockbuster to underperform with its core fanbase, lagging well behind the 2014 reboot with a modest $35.3m opening (the first film earned $65.6m within its first three days of release). The week before, Disney’s long in the works sequel, Alice Through the Looking Glass, launched to even less with $26.9m, coming in a whopping 77% behind Alice in Wonderland. That same week, X-Men: Apocalypse trounced Alice with $65.8m – but even that sum couldn’t come close to matching the $90.8m that the previous X-Men film, Days of Future Past, made over the same timeframe in 2014. Worst hit, though, was The Huntsman: Winter’s War, a follow-up to 2012’s box office smash Snow White and the Huntsman, which limped its way to the finish line earning just $47.6m in the US, after opening in April to a dismal $19.4m during its opening weekend. Even Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising suffered, coming in over 50% below Neighbors at its debut, proving that comedies aren’t immune. Flopping isn’t the only thing all these summer films have in common – they were all also largely negatively reviewed. It’s therefore telling that Captain America: Civil War, the only sequel to receive rave notices this season, is also the only one to rake in a billion dollars. In 2015, the five films to hit or surpass that mark were all sequels. So far, the only other film to join the enviable club is Zootopia, which is itself a wholly original property. Still, Captain America, which is widely considered to be a third Avengers film despite its title, has failed to match the heights set by the first two films in the superhero franchise. Studios can console themselves in believing that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice serves as an exception to the trend, since it grossed $871.9m worldwide, eclipsing Man of Steel, which earned $668m in 2013. But as the film touted to launch Warner Bros’ ambitious Justice League cinematic universe, the failure to cross the billion-dollar line is a troubling kickoff for Warner Bros. The terrible reviews Zac Snyder’s film was lambasted with couldn’t have helped matters. As box-office analyst Paul Dergarabedian affirmed to the Hollywood Reporter: “Sequels of late have fallen on rough times.” “2016 has proven to be a very tough battleground, and the landscape has been littered with a series of sequels that have come up short, and thus call into question the entire notion of the inherent appeal of non-original, franchise-based content,” he added. Pixar’s upcoming sequel to Finding Nemo, Finding Dory, is the film expected to buck Hollywood’s summer of discontent. Variety reports that the animated comedy is on pace to give the studio the biggest opening of its history when it opens on 17 June. Analysts are pegging it to a debut between $115m and $120m, ahead of Pixar’s biggest opener yet, Toy Story 3, which bowed to $110m in 2010. Should Finding Dory perform as predicted, it would blow past the $70m opening of Finding Nemo in 2003, and likely eclipse the $936.7m it made worldwide. Reviews have yet to hit for the pic, but given Pixar’s stellar track-record (save for Cars 2), Finding Dory should be in good shape. The jury is still out on how Independence Day: Resurgence will go over once it bows later this month. It could very well hit a retro nerve like Jurassic World did last summer and do massive business. Or it could perform on par with director Roland Emmerich’s last two blockbusters (White House Down and 2012) - and fail to crack the billion dollar ceiling. Whatever the outcome, this season has hopefully served as a wake-up call to Hollywood to produce more original content, and make sequels that do the originals proud.\n",
      "‘First step’ taken towards introducing safe standing in Premier League The 20 top-flight clubs have tasked the Premier League with scoping out the issues surrounding safe standing to inform a debate about whether it could be introduced in England. The move was described as “probably the first step” towards safe standing by David Gold, a co-owner of West Ham and one of the more enthusiastic proponents of the plan. After discussing the subject formally for the first time on Thursday, amid signs of a shifting mood among the majority of Premier League clubs, league executives were mandated to conduct a fact-finding exercise. “Premier League clubs today held initial discussions on safe standing. Given that fan safety is of paramount concern clubs are understandably cautious and there was no overall consensus on the matter,” said a spokesman. “This is a complex and emotive topic with a number of issues, varying from club to club, which need to be considered carefully before clubs can decide if they wish to pursue any changes, including legislative, that are required to allow them the option of safe standing areas in their grounds.” A number of potential hurdles remain before the sort of rail seating commonplace in Germany and introduced at Celtic Park for the first time this season could be considered in the Premier League and Championship. Among them are the sensitivities around the Hillsborough disaster, with the Hillsborough Family Support Group remaining implacably opposed to any move that would allow standing in major English grounds. However, the Liverpool supporters’ group Spirit of Shankly has launched a consultation on the matter and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign has also said it supports a full debate of the issues. Those who support safe standing argue that it would not mean a return to the unsafe terraces of old but in fact should be safer than the current situation, where many fans stand in front of their seats in defiance of the rules. It is understood that the government believes the introduction of safe standing would require a change in the law but that it would involve relatively straightforward secondary legislation. At present, however, the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, is not minded to recommend any change. “The government currently has no plans to change its position and introduce standing accommodation at grounds covered by the all-seater requirement,” said a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. A majority of Premier League clubs are now believed to be in favour of trials, however, while Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have designed their new stadiums to be able to accommodate rail seating if it is allowed. The Premier League will investigate the full range of issues around the topic before reporting back to the clubs. “The clubs have tasked the Premier League with scoping out the safety, supporter, technical and legislative issues surrounding safe standing before any further discussions, based on the facts, can take place,” said a spokesman. Any review is also likely to examine how the experience of introducing rail seating for almost 3,000 fans has played out north of the border, where Celtic introduced it this season. Delegations from a number of clubs, including Manchester City and Manchester United, are due to travel to Scotland to see it in action this season.\n",
      "Serie A’s challenge to Premier League’s fourth Champions League spot There is a bigger picture when Premier League sides return to European action in the next 11 days – the safety of England’s fourth Champions League place. Italy is close behind in Uefa’s list of coefficients that determines the number of places each country will have in the 2017‑18 season. England is third and has had four places since 2001 (including one, currently, via the play-offs) – but Juventus reaching the Champions League final and runs by Napoli and Fiorentina to the Europa League semi‑finals last season helped boost Italy’s one-year rating to 19.000, way ahead of England’s 13.571. Serie A’s five-season total is 69.272, compared with 72.659. Most points are awarded on the basis of two for a win and one for a draw across both the Champions League and Europa League, though there are sizeable bonuses for progress in the senior competition and meagre ones for the junior one. The overall points total is then divided by the number of entering clubs a country has. Is trouble brewing? England has an extra side remaining in the Champions League – Juventus and Roma are representing Italy – and three sides in the Europa League to Italy’s two. Also, last season was the only one in the past five when Serie A was superior the Premier League. But that always happened by comparatively small margins and English clubs need a good season of their own in both competitions to fend off the Italian challenge in the short- and long-term.\n",
      "From The Dress to the 'extinction effect': the internet obsession with brain teasers From widely shared optical illusions and brain teasers to the strange, blue-and-black phenomenon that was The Dress, it’s clear that the internet is infatuated with puzzles. The latest which seems to have captured collective attention is about choosing which box contains a car. Posted on Monday by the Daily Mail, the puzzle was found on Brilliant.org, a problem-solving site. The premise: there are three boxes and one has a car in it. Each box has a statement attached to it, but only one of the statements is true. The statement on Box 1 reads “The car is in this box”. On Box 2: “The car is not in this box.” Box 3: “The car is not in box 1.” So which box contains the car? It’s similar to other puzzles, such as one called Evil King Berman and the Three Boxes. That one features a picture of “Fair Maiden Rowena” in one of three boxes made of gold, silver and lead (making it vaguely reminiscent of the three caskets test in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice). The fascination with the car puzzle follows a slew of recent viral visual illusions. A photo of a girl’s legs left Twitter users scratching their heads, wondering if the legs were very shiny or splattered with white paint. It earned over 16,000 retweets and plenty of news coverage. A similar debate ensued over a 2013 photo of a man imitating a crying baby. When the photo resurfaced last week thanks to Reddit, many debated whether the man pictured was Bill Murray or Tom Hanks. A particularly challenging game of I-Spy took over the internet in July, after a woman uploaded a photo of a floral carpet and coffee table to Facebook. “Look for the cellphone,” the caption read. The phone’s case is a close match to the pattern of the carpet, making it difficult to find. (Need a hint? Look near the table’s legs). A photo of gray lines on a white background with black dots that seem to move with the viewer’s eyes gained attention in September. Posted to Facebook by Akiyoshi Kitaoka, a psychology professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan, the image actually contains 12 black dots, even if you can’t see them all at once. Only the black dots within a person’s field of vision appear. The headache-inducing image is an example of the “extinction effect” and was created by the researchers Jacques Ninio and Kent A Stevens, according to Quartz. It was a variation on the Hermann grid and scintillating grid illusions. The Hermann grid is a famous illusion with a black background and a grid of white lines. When you stare at one intersection, the others all seem to be filled with grey. The scintillating grid is a variation of this, with a grey grid and black background. A white disk is placed at each intersection, making black dots seem to appear and disappear. The grid created by Ninio and Stevens places outlined circles at the intersections of a more complicated grid, which makes the circles outside the field of vision seem to disappear.\n",
      "Jack Colback seals stirring comeback as Benítez’s Newcastle hold Liverpool A day to forget for Jürgen Klopp could ultimately prove one to savour for Rafael Benítez. Liverpool began the day under a cloud courtesy of Mamadou Sakho’s failed drugs test and Newcastle United’s stirring recovery from two goals down ensured they stayed there. Belief, character and a touch of fortune, all the ingredients required in a relegation contest, were evident as the visitors collected their first point on the road since 13 December. Benítez had asked his former club for a favour in his quest to preserve Newcastle’s Premier League status and the ex-Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet obliged. Liverpool were coasting at the interval to a fifth straight win in all competitions but Mignolet’s mistake allowed Papiss Cissé to reduce the arrears and, from nowhere, Newcastle had a fighting chance. They capitalised to close the gap on fourth-from-bottom Norwich City to one point and maintain the momentum that is building under their belatedly-appointed coach. “Maybe before the game Newcastle thought they could win at Anfield,” said Klopp. “But now I would say they are happy with a point. Two shots on target, two goals. It is not too good to be honest but we have to accept it.” The Liverpool manager may also have to accept whatever sanction is heading Sakho’s way for failing a Uefa drugs test after the Europa League tie at Old Trafford on 17 March. In purely football terms, and Klopp could not say much about Sakho given the defender has until Tuesday to respond, Liverpool’s resilience in his absence was not encouraging. Sakho sat in an executive box with his family as his team-mates eased into a two-goal lead in the first half. Any hopes Newcastle harboured of two encouraging displays at St James’ Park translating into improvement on the road were put on hold after 58 seconds. That was all the time it took for Daniel Sturridge to reassure Anfield in the absence of the injured Divock Origi and score his seventh goal in his last seven starts against Newcastle. Benítez was warmly serenaded by the Kop on his return to Anfield – it was not so easy last time he was in the opposition dugout as Chelsea’s interim manager – and he had just reciprocated with a wave when Liverpool were awarded a free-kick on the halfway line. Klopp’s team had gone long and early with two balls into the Newcastle area from the kick-off and the reason why was underlined from Alberto Moreno’s set piece. Sturridge had two defenders on his shoulders as Moreno’s ball dropped on the edge of the penalty area yet he was given space to control neatly, turn sharply and stroke a clinical left-foot finish into Karl Darlow’s bottom left-hand corner. The visitors’ gameplan to contain Liverpool with a 4-1-4-1 formation was damaged before it had been executed. Newcastle lacked the aggression or the confidence to react positively in the first half, their performance was far removed from Tuesday’s committed show at home to Manchester City, and Liverpool inflicted further punishment on their passive opponent with another fine goal on the half-hour. Dejan Lovren found Roberto Firmino in space and the stylish Brazilian released Moreno down the left. Liverpool’s full-back produced his second assist by picking out the unmarked Adam Lallana in the centre. From 20 yards, the midfielder swept a stunning finish into the top corner and three more points beckoned. Liverpool’s latest commanding display was not the only reason to suspect the contest was over. Their only concerns of the first half were slight knocks to Moreno and Lovren, neither serious, and referee Andre Marriner’s refusal to award a penalty for handball. Marriner was a late replacement for Martin Atkinson who reportedly suffered an injury on a Uefa fitness course. Newcastle had offered nothing, which made their second-half fightback all the more surprising and, for Klopp, galling. Benítez’s side were gifted a lifeline shortly after the restart when Vurnon Anita broke down the right and crossed deep into the Liverpool six-yard box. Mignolet rushed from his line but his fists made no contact with the ball, only with the unfortunate Lovren, and Cissé headed into the unguarded goal. Cissé should have levelled and left Anfield enraged when Sturridge was denied a penalty having been clipped inside the area. Marriner waved play on, Newcastle broke through Moussa Sissoko and the captain put the Senegal international clear on goal. The striker wanted too long on the ball, however, and could only pass back to Andros Townsend who blazed high into the Kop. Firmino tapped in from close range after Darlow saved from Joe Allen’s header but an offside flag came to Newcastle’s rescue. They capitalised from another attack down the Liverpool left. This time Townsend centred into the heart of the home penalty area and, though Cissé could not connect with a clean header, the ball dropped for Jack Colback to score his first away goal in over two years via a deflection off Lovren. After nine consecutive league defeats away from home, Newcastle’s away support revelled in the release long after the final whistle.\n",
      "Economics and talent drain contribute to Newcastle and Sunderland’s woes In this least predictable of seasons there have been only two things on which to rely: the ineptitude of Aston Villa and the slightly lesser ineptitude of the north-east. Perhaps Norwich City will end up relegating both Sunderland and Newcastle United, perhaps Swansea City or Crystal Palace will collapse and both will be saved, but at this stage the derby on Sunday feels like a relegation shootout, in terms of its long-term consequences potentially a more significant Tyne-Wear derby even than the 1990 play-off semi. Given the sense of despondency around both clubs it is realistic to fear that, unlike their last relegations, there would be no swift return. The imminence of the new Premier League television deal heightens the apocalyptic mood. There seems something grimly appropriate that this great clash of north-eastern powers should fall on the feast day of St Cuthbert, protector of the region. Behind the anxiety and the anticipation lies the perpetual question of why. Why should an area that has given so much to football from its origins (Charles W Alcock, first secretary of the Football Association, progenitor of the FA Cup and internationals, was born in Sunderland), where 40,000 crowds are the norm despite often dismal football, that has provided more England internationals per head of population than anywhere else, be locked always in a battle for relevance? In 1986-87 Peter Beardsley attended a talk-in at a social club. He was 26 and, in the season after his sparkling performances at the World Cup, his future at Newcastle had been the subject of much discussion. A member of the audience stood up. “Get yourself away, Peter,” he said. “You’re too good for this club.” The rest of the room got to their feet and applauded. On the one hand it’s a scene that speaks of a refreshing realism and generosity. Beardsley was a brilliant player and would leave at the end of that season for Liverpool, where he won two league titles and an FA Cup. But there’s also something devastating about the sense of acceptance of place. Newcastle finished 17th in the top flight that season (which was rather better than Sunderland, who were relegated to the Third Division for the only time in their history), but they also had in their squad the 20-year-old Paul Gascoigne. A year later he would be sold. A year after that Newcastle were relegated. A year after that England reached the World Cup semi-final with a team that included Beardsley, Gascoigne and Chris Waddle, who had been sold in 1985. This was the north-east I grew up with, a land where it never did to hope too much. (There is a paradox to the present situation for Sunderland in that, however miserable the eternal relegation struggles may feel, this spell of nine successive seasons in the top fight is their longest since they were first relegated in 1958.) Opportunities existed to be missed, as Sunderland lost in the Milk Cup final of 1985 and the FA Cup final of 1992. Success wasn’t for the likes of us. We Sunderland fans all knew the history. We could all recite chunks of both the BBC and ITV commentaries of the 1973 Cup final. We even came to resent it a little once the realisation set in that the only reason it meant so much was because for most of the post-war era we had been so crap. Because we also knew about beating Hearts for the first championship of the world in 1895, about nearly winning the Double in 1913 and about Raich Carter’s league- and Cup-winning sides of the mid-30s. But that was then, when Sunderland was a thriving industrial city (between September 1939 and the end of 1944 Sunderland produced 1.5m tons of ships, 27% of the UK’s total output; in 1938 the whole of the US had produced only 201,251 tons). By the 1980s the shipyards had gone, the mines had gone, the jobs had gone; of course the football had gone. Everything had gone. We looked at the rise of clubs such as Luton, Wimbledon and Millwall, at West Ham finishing third, and understood in some vague, nonspecific way that this was some inevitable consequence of Thatcherite economics: that the centre boomed while the periphery dwindled. Thirty years later it seems to be happening again. Money has become ever more important in football. London has more money than anywhere else, draws investment better than anywhere else and so, naturally, clubs from the capital and its surroundings have risen. Tottenham have joined Chelsea and Arsenal at the highest table. West Ham, as they prepare to move into the Olympic Stadium, may not be too far behind. Watford and Crystal Palace have played each other 100 times in the league; this season was the first in which they had met in the top flight. The north-east, meanwhile, struggles. It has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 8.6% and, with an average income of £345 per week, is in the lowest earnings bracket recognised by the Office for National Statistics. Necessarily that has an impact. Looking at median season-ticket prices, for instance, only Stoke charge less than Sunderland. Arsenal make more in match-day revenue in three games than Sunderland do in a season. Sunderland are the sixth most successful side in English league history in terms of titles won, 10th in terms of points won in the top division and last season had the sixth-highest average attendance. Yet they have finished in the top half of the top division only three times in the past half-century. In terms of titles won Newcastle are the eighth-best side in English history and ninth in terms of total points won in the top flight. Their average attendance was the third best in the league last season. In terms of history and support base both are significantly underperforming and, Newcastle’s dalliance with the top four under Kevin Keegan and Bobby Robson aside, they have been for half a century or more. That’s why the economic argument, leading to a general sense of resignation or pessimism, seemed to me compelling. But when the Swedish magazine Offside asked me to look at the reasons for the north-east’s underperformance I found the view within the north-east is rather different. “It’s not that failure is hard-wired into the north-east,” says Michael Martin, the editor of True Faith and a senior member of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust. He cites as examples the success of Durham in cricket (three County Championships and two one-day cups in the past nine years) and basketball’s Newcastle Eagles (seven BBL Championships in the past decade). Which is true, but of course it takes far less money to compete in cricket or basketball than in the Premier League – and even then, Durham, for all the advantages of having a Test ground, have had to be financially cautious, their success rooted in homegrown players. Harry Pearson, author of The Far Corner, a brilliant examination of the spirit of north-eastern football and its in-built nostalgia, points out that when money isn’t the major issue the north-east still excels at football. Six of the past seven winners of the FA Vase – and two of the losing finalists – are from the region. “It’s almost like we accept that as our level, or at least feel more comfortable there,” he says. “I think the failure in the professional game has something to do with that – an innate inferiority complex. There’s always been a feeling that in order to succeed you have to leave.” I left. I’m not even sure I thought about it: it just seemed like what you did after university. Of my eight closest friends from school only one still lives in the north-east. That’s not to say that you cannot succeed in the north-east but the mentality of looking elsewhere is undeniable. Between 1963 and 1987 north-eastern managers won 14 league titles, five FA Cups, five European Cups, three Uefa or Fairs Cups and a Cup-Winners’ Cup. But none of Harry Catterick, Don Revie, Brian Clough, Bob Paisley, Howard Kendall or Bobby Robson won anything with a north-eastern side; Bob Stokoe’s 1973 miracle stands alone (although Newcastle in 1969 won the Fairs Cup under the Doncaster-born Joe Harvey). Why that seam no longer yields the riches it once did is another question but, when it did exist, the advantages were enjoyed elsewhere. The foundations that might have led a club to prosper despite local economics were never laid. David Rose, the deputy chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation and a Sunderland fan, points to Everton as a club of similar stature that seem always to do better. Martin highlights Stoke, Swansea and Southampton as examples of smaller clubs who do better than Newcastle because of more enlightened management. “The two clubs are badly managed in different ways,” says Mark Jensen, the editor of the Newcastle fanzine the Mag. “They’re incompetent but ours has been cynically done.” And they’re right, of course, that Sunderland and Newcastle have suffered from poor recent leadership. Newcastle’s now apparently abandoned policy of signing only players under the age of 26 so they can be sold at a profit has been heavily criticised but Sunderland in the past five years, satisfying the whims of each passing manager and casting desperately against relegation, have signed 67 players. That not only makes it harder for players to feel a visceral connection to the club, it also breaks down the emotional bond between fans and players. “Are there any of them I’d be sorry to see leave?” Rose asks. “Not really, no.” It cannot be denied that both clubs have been hampered by poor leadership, but the fundamental point remains that the tighter the finances are, the better the leadership has to be for the club to prosper. The economics are against them as they have been since the end of the war. For one club, Cuthbert’s Day could mark the beginning of a very bleak period indeed. Failure stalks his domain.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton pushed to the limit as Cruz beats Trump in Iowa caucuses Hillary Clinton was given the fright of her life as veteran socialist senator Bernie Sanders pushed her to the limit in the Iowa caucuses, on a night of extreme drama in the first test of the US presidential election year. Ted Cruz, the maverick Texas senator, used his formidable ground game to beat the bombastic property tycoon Donald Trump into second place in the Republican race. And with Florida senator Marco Rubio enjoying a strong night in third place, the congested Republican field could yet be reshaped as a head-to-head between two Cuban Americans vying to become the first Latino president of the United States. Yet it was in the Democratic race where the closest of finishes caused high anxiety in the Clinton camp. With more than 99% of the precinct results in, Clinton led 49.9% to 49.6% over Sanders after seeing an apparently comfortable lead slip. The Associated Press and multiple outlets said the race was simply too close to call, though the Clinton camp claimed a narrow victory. Both candidates will now move on to New Hampshire buoyed up, Clinton with a “sigh of relief” that her bid to be the first female president of the United States is alive, and Sanders believing that his revolution against the “billionaire classes” truly began in the snowy cornfields of Iowa. With half of the results in across the rural midwest state, Clinton appeared to be easing to victory, three points up on the Vermont senator, whose relatively ramshackle campaign seemed to be no match for her mighty political machine. But as the night wore on, Clinton’s lead shrank to two and then one point, until she was locked in a virtual tie with the 74-year-old whose passion has ignited a fervour among young Americans. Appearing onstage in Des Moines before the final tally arrived, Clinton hailed “a contest of ideas” and appeared battle-ready for the fight of her political life. She congratulated her opponent, saying: “I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us in America.” The democratic socialist, though, has stolen some momentum heading into the New Hampshire primary on 9 February – and a prolonged fight appears inevitable, a far cry from what had been envisaged as a graceful procession toward the nomination for Clinton. By almost 11pm local time, the two Democratic rivals had both given what sounded like competing victory speeches. Sanders raised the roof as he told supporters: “While the results are still not known, it looks like we are in virtual tie,” adding: “The people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, the economic establishment, and by the way to the media establishment.” Largely written off by both the media and Democratic leaders, Sanders has been attracting huge crowds across the state since he first started campaigning here in the summer and made Clinton’s poll leads that reached as high as 32% all but evaporate. Late on Monday night in Des Moines, a crowd at Sanders’ victory party was watching him inch to within 0.2 percentage points down, to a tie on the television overhead, then back down to 0.2 points. Someone put on Sanders’ fight song – the Simon & Garfunkel anthem America. “They’ve all come to look for America,” sang the throng. Speaking to reporters on a chartered plane flying to New Hampshire, Sanders called on officials to take the unusual step of revealing underlying voter totals. Delegates are awarded in the Iowa Democratic contest on a precint-by-precinct basis, irrespective of the state-wide vote for each candidate. “I honestly don’t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be honest,” he said. “I have no idea, did we win the popular vote? I don’t know, but as much information as possible should be made available.” At the Clinton event, the former first lady, secretary of state and senator was introduced by retired Iowa senator Tom Harkin and his wife Ruth, both popular figures who endorsed Clinton last summer. Harkin embraced what he said was a “narrow” victory for Clinton, even as the results were still being counted. “Hey, folks, a win is a win!” he exclaimed. Later on, Clinton’s campaign director in Iowa, Matt Paul, said there was “no uncertainty” that Clinton had won. Clinton herself stopped short of declaring victory as she took the stage, flanked by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, before a crowd of roughly 700 supporters. “Wow, what a night, an unbelievable night,” she said. “Now, as I stand here tonight breathing a sigh of relief – thank you.” At times the cheers so deafening they drowned out Clinton’s words. It was an outright celebration, however narrow the result, of a candidate who eight years ago suffered a bruising defeat in the same state at the hands of Barack Obama. This time, she will head to New Hampshire having hit her stride – campaigning laboriously for every vote. Last time she slipped to third in Iowa behind Obama and John Edwards. As midnight approached, with 50 of the 1,683 precincts still to declare, Clinton led 49.9% to 49.6%. However, rumours began to circulate that some of the results were in dispute and that the Democratic party had failed to staff 90 caucuses, raising the prospect of an ugly clash between the Clinton and Sanders camps. In the Republican contest, it was a predictably chastening night for Jeb Bush, the candidate with all of the money and the presidential lineage who has been diminished by the taunts of Donald Trump saying he is “low energy”. Bush barely registered, in sixth place at 2.8% behind retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson in fourth and libertarian Rand Paul in fifth. But the Republican night belonged to Cruz, who called it “a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation”, vowing that the Republican nominee for 2016 “will not be chosen by the Washington establishment”. If the taming of Trump was a surprise – Cruz picked up the most votes ever in a Republican Iowa caucus – there is also a warning from history. In the last seven contested national caucuses, they have chosen the eventual nominee only three times. Donald Trump gave a rare display of humility during a brief speech at a hotel in West Des Moines. “We finished second and I want to tell you seriously I am honoured,” he said, making a point to “congratulate Ted”. After months of crowing about how he was destined to win, he immediately moved to reframe expectations, saying that he had been warned “do not to go to Iowa. You could never finish even in the top 10”. “We’re just so happy about the way everything turned out,” he added. However, the mood at Donald Trump’s party in western Des Moines went from subdued when it emerged he had been pushed into second place by Cruz, to outright downbeat when it became apparent he had been almost tied by third-place Rubio. A defiant Rubio echoed the words of Barack Obama in 2008 when he took the stage at his caucus night party in Des Moines. “So this is the moment they said would never happen. For months, they told us we had no chance,” Rubio told a raucous crowd inside a ballroom at the downtown Marriott. “They told me I needed to wait my turn. They told me we had no chance because my hair wasn’t gray enough and my boots were too high,” he said, referring to a minor media storm about his Cuban heel boots. “But tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state have sent a very clear message after seven years of Barack Obama we are not waiting any longer,” he added. If Rubio can lead the establishment crowd in New Hampshire, Chris Christie, John Kasich and Jeb Bush will be all but done and he may come through the middle as a youthful alternative. Cruz is deeply unpopular in his own party and Trump is diminished if not yet vanquished. “Ground game, ground game, ground game” was the reason that Cruz’s Iowa’s co- chair Matt Schultz gave for his candidate’s triumph. Cruz staffers had long been supremely confident that they had the resources on the ground to triumph and felt confident that they had done everything right. Unlike Trump, their candidate had visited all 99 counties and built up what was universally acknowledged to be the best field organisation of any candidate. The mood at the Cruz party was jubilant. A cover band played rock and country music as attendees slowly started to grasp their achievement in winning the caucuses. The crowd’s enthusiasm barely flagged as Cruz spoke for about 25 minutes to the assembled audience at the Elwell building on the grounds of the Iowa state fair. In an interview on caucus day, Cruz’s state director, Bryan English, told the that their organisation “was a model”. “It’s an organic process … go straight to people, meeting them where they are, in twos, threes, and fives, then dozens, hundreds and thousands … It’s not through paid media, not through direct mail, but through person-to-person relationship building.” The two casualties of the night were Martin O’Malley, who dropped out of the Democratic race, and Mike Huckabee, who suspended his Republican campaign.\n",
      "Man climbs Trump Tower in New York City using suction cups A 20-year-old Virginia man seeking an “audience” with Donald Trump used large suction cups to scale the outside of Trump Tower on Wednesday for three hours, reaching the 21st floor before being hauled through a window by police. The climber – a young, white male with long brown hair and muttonchops – wore a backpack and used a harness and rope stirrups to fasten himself to the side of the 58-story Manhattan skyscraper, above Fifth Avenue. The man used four suction cup-like devices, each with ropes attached for him to stand on. The building’s windows were apparently too dirty for the cups to attach to, as he frequently stopped to clean the windows before attempting to attach to them. Police officers smashed windows and broke through a ventilation duct in an attempt to block his progress. Officers also lowered themselves toward him using a window washer’s platform. For a long time, the climber played a slow-motion cat-and-mouse game with officers, eluding them by methodically working his way across the facade and the angled corners of the building. The chase ended dramatically just after 6.30pm. As a crowd gasped on the street below, two officers leaning far out of a window frame where the glass was removed grabbed the climber’s arm and backpack, and in a flash yanked him from his dangling stirrups. He went through the opening head first, his legs pointed skyward. Police had deployed large, inflated crash pads at the scene, but it was unclear whether they were positioned close enough to where the man was climbing to offer any protection if he fell. He was speaking with officers through the holes cut in the side of the building. When would-be rescuers smashed a window above him, he ducked to avoid big shards of glass that fell. They collectively inhaled as he was pulled inside. “I’m so disappointed,” a young man said. Others sadly lamented that they missed it. Police blocked off much of 56th Street, the south side of the tower, where the man was climbing. The crowds pressed together in the heat and humidity and spilled onto Madison Avenue. With smartphones and cameras raised, they documented the strange occurrence on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook Live. In offices nearby, some watched from the windows. “I gotta get this shit on camera. This is hilarious,” one man said. Others wondered if the climber – whom many were calling Steve – was getting tired. Another yelled “Make America great again”. Others offered their own theories on why the man was doing this. “It’s gotta be a protest,” a man said. Some disagreed. “I think it’s just a daredevil,” said Carolyn Gatchell, a nurse from New Hampshire. “I think it’s ironic because it’s a Trump building. I’m anxious to see what he has to say about it.” Gatchell and her husband, Bill, in town on vacation, were at the Empire State building when they saw helicopters near Trump Tower so they headed down to check out what was going on. “I think it’s innocent – not a terrorist or anything,” Bill added of the climbers’ motivation. The day before, police said, the climber posted a video on YouTube entitled: Message to Mr Trump (why I climbed your tower). “I am an independent researcher seeking a private audience with you to discuss an important matter. I guarantee that it’s in your interest to honor this request,” he said in the video. “Believe me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it. The reason I climbed your tower is to get your attention. If I had sought this via conventional means, I would be much less likely to have success because you are a busy man with many responsibilities.” NYPD assistant chief William Aubrey said the man, who was not named by police, told officers the same thing after he was safely inside the building. “At no time did he express that he wanted to hurt anybody,” Aubrey added. The tower is headquarters to Trump’s Republican presidential campaign and his business empire. Trump also lives there, though he was in Virginia on Wednesday afternoon and was headed to Florida for an evening event. Kathy, a Trump supporter from Sunnyside, was visiting a friend nearby when she saw the crowds. She said she used to work in the building but not for Trump and was concerned for the safety of former coworkers who might be there, as well as Trump. She was relieved to find out that he was away . “People want to be around him,” she said of Trump. “They will glom onto anything like him. Look how much attention this guy is getting.” About 20 police officers funneled curious onlookers out of the street so cars could pass unhindered down Madison Avenue. Those who moved across the street could still see the building where the climber was approaching an open window and police.\n",
      "Middlesbrough 0-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened! That’s six wins in a row for Chelsea – and they have kept a clean sheet in every one of them, scoring 17 without reply. Antonio Conte is on the pitch, hugging his players. They are in brilliant form and looking very difficult to break down. Boro battled hard and if they continue performing like this should be fine. They remain one point above the bottom three as it stands. Thanks for reading. Bye! Chelsea are top of the league thanks to yet another Diego Costa goal. 90 min +4: With 20 seconds to go Barragan tries to find Ramirez down the right channel with a long ball but puts too much juice on it. That should be that. Chelsea will finish the weekend on top of the league. 90 min +3: Tick, tock, tick, tock. Chelsea are closing this out with very little bother. 90 min +1: Costa shoots from range, accidentally catching Gibson on the shin in the process. He picks the Boro defender up – what sportsmanship! Chelsea’s final change sees Hazard stroll off, with Oscar coming on for him. 90 min: There will be at least four minutes of added time. 89 min: Moses comes off – slowly – for Ivanovic, who has found game time hard to come by since that horror against Arsenal. Boro’s final sub sees Leadbitter return, replacing Forshaw. 89 min: Eventually Downing tries to find Negredo with a cross from the left but it’s too deep. Goal kick. 88 min: Boro pop it about in midfield but are struggling to find a way through Chelsea’s defence. They really have become masters of shutting games down. 86 min: The attempt beats the wall but does not dip sufficiently to threaten Valdes. 84 min: Ramirez fouls Hazard on the edge of the box. It’s clumsy rather than naughty, but this is very dangerous indeed. David Luiz is eyeing it up. Boro are forming a four-man wall, which Cahill and Costa join to impede Valdes’s view. 83 min: Alonso – cleverly, cynically; delete depending on which team you support – brings down Fischer near halfway as Boro sought to counter on the right. 80 min: Chelsea’s first change sees Chalobah, who was on loan at Boro in the Championship, replace Pedro. Chalobah will sit next to Kanté and Matic. 78 min: Pedro and Costa combine brilliantly but Boro get enough bodies in the way and then rapidly break through Traore. This time he decides to pass to Negredo. The former Man City striker takes a magnificent first touch and his shot is on target … but Courtois is alert to make his first proper save of the evening. 75 min: Traore picks up possession down the right and has options to cross or layoff but instead shoots wildly over from an improbable distance. Fischer and Negredo are furious with their team-mate. 74 min: Chambers is booked after Costa turns him on halfway and the defender tugs the Chelsea striker to the floor. 73 min: Fischer is now on, replacing Clayton. Realistically, it is hard to see Boro finding a way past this Chelsea defence. 71 min: Boro are making two changes in the hope of reversing their fortunes. Downing is the first on, coming in for Fabio. Fischer is also ready to come on but play resumes with a Chelsea throw before he is introduced. 65 min: … who quickly sets away Chelsea on the counter. They are four v four with Costa in possession. His threaded through ball picks out Moses. He cannot finish, lofting the ball over Valdes’s goal. 65 min: And now Traore wins a corner at the opposite end. It ends up being smothered by Courtois … 63 min: Chelsea hit the bar! Costa does well in the buildup to knock down a David Luiz cross for Pedro, but his effort comes back off the bar with Valdes beaten. 62 min: Barragan tries to find Negredo from the right but David Luiz gets to the ball first and Courtois follows up to smother. 61 min: Now Traore has a shot blocked before slipping before connecting with the rebound. Boro are suddenly back in this and enjoying their best spell for some time. 59 min: You probably only need one hand to count Premier League players faster than Traore. He races past four Chelsea players in the blink of an eye before being taken down by Kante near halfway. 55 min: But now Boro have a good chance. Negredo steps over a Clayton pass, allowing Ramirez to run on to the ball. The shot, however, drifts over Courtois’ bar. 54 min: Chelsea are so, so comfortable. They are barely breaking sweat and Boro could be doing a lot more to pressure them. 52 min: His strike comes off the wall, specifically the forehead of David Luiz. 51 min: Azpilicueta is yellow carded for dragging down Ramirez after a poor touch from the defender allowed the Boro attacker possession. This certainly within range for Ramirez. 49 min: De Roon fouls Costa cynically near halfway, standing on the Chelsea player’s toes. In the past the striker would have reacted angrily to that. De Roon gets a final warning from the referee. Next time, he’ll be booked. 46 min: Valdes does well to deny Alonso inside 20 seconds, while Chambers does well to disrupt Pedro on the rebound. 46 min: Costa gets us going again. Can Boro respond? Negredo was anonymous in the opening 45, so he needs to improved considerably. Diego Costa’s goal is the difference at the break. 45 min: There will be two minutes added time. 44 min: Ramirez harries Azpilicueta but concedes a foul for nudging the Chelsea defender on the back as he attempted to head away a long hook forward. 41 min: And from the corner Chelsea score. It’s Costa’s 10th of the season but Boro can only blame themselves for some woeful defending. The ball bobbles around the near post and Chambers fails to clear, inadvertently playing Costa in. He screws the ball home first time. 40 min: Moses, picked out by Costa, steps over the ball and dazzles Fabio before his shot is deflected out for a corner. 37 min: A minute later Chelsea attack through Hazard and then Costa, who squares to Pedro. He pulls the ball back to Kanté and he feeds Alonso on the left. The wing-back’s cross is cleared by Valdes, who gets a nasty knock on the back of the head for his troubles. 36 min: Boro have just taken some time to play a bit of keep ball but Traore has no interest in continuing that so races down the left, leaving Kante and Cahill in his wake and sends a cross from the right. David Luiz clears. 35 min: Kante attempts a speculative long range pass for Costa. It’s bread and butter for Valdes. 33 min: Boro could do with getting their foot on the ball for a minute or so to stem this onslaught. It now seems only a matter of time before Chelsea open the scoring. 31 min: Chelsea are dominant. Costa turns four Boro players on the D before picking out Pedro all alone on the right. The Spain attacker is caught in two minds, however – does he shoot or does he cross? Instead it is somewhere in between and Valdes makes an easy stop. 29 min: What a save from Valdes! Hazard picks out Moses down the right with a delightful lofted pass. He squares to Pedro, who attempts to sidefoot the ball home only for the keeper to get a fingertip on the shot, turning it over the bar for a corner. 27 min: David Luiz heads the ball straight to De Roon in a dangerous position but the Boro midfielder is whistled at for using his hands to control. 26 min: Alonso latches on to a Valdes clearance and shoots well wide. In the last five minutes, Chelsea have had 91% possession. 24 min: There has been a lot of hard work and it is by no means the worst game ever seen but we are still waiting for a shot on target. 22 min: Moses picks out Alonso with a deep cross from the right but the wing-back’s touch is poor, resulting in a goal-kick for Boro. 21 min: Ramirez is working very hard here, something you can’t always say. He beats Azpilicueta for pace on the left, which is no mean feat but eventually cuts in due to no options in front of him and Boro are unable to translate what appeared a promising break into an opportunity. 19 min: Moses shoots wild and wide after getting past Da Silva following a one-two with Hazard. 18 min: Ramírez is played into possession down the right by Barragan but he raises his head to check what options are around him and takes a poor touch, kicking the ball out of play. 17 min: Da Silva does well to track Moses, who is picked out by a lovely ball from Matic, and block a threatening cross. The corner is cleared. 15 min: Kante sends a diagonal pass meant for Moses on the right into the stands. “Wahey!” shout the home fans. 14 min: Chambers intercepts a below par Hazard cross from the left. This game is lacking a spark. 13 min: Seconds later Matic fouls Traore just inside Chelsea’s half. 12 min: Negredo drops deep to get his foot on the ball and is tracked by David Luiz, who clips the striker from behind. It’s a free-kick but nothing more. 10 min: Hazard is continuing but limping. He curls a harmless effort straight into Valdes’s arms. 8 min: Clayton is booked for bringing down Hazard, who shrugs off a challenge from De Roon with a tasty turn before being clattered by Clayton’s follow up challenge. That’s his third of the season. Hazard remains down and is getting some attention to his right ankle. 8 min: Boro have shaded the opening exchanges. Chelsea have yet to settle. 6 min: Ramirez dribbles forward after David Luiz misjudges a long ball from Da Silva but the Boro attacker’s cross to De Roon is a tad misplaced. The Dutchman checks his run and the move eventually ends with Traoré’s cross from the right being blocked. 5 min: Boro are a bit hasty when playing the ball out from the back, leading to Pedro pressing Gibson into hooking out for a throw. 4 min: Ramirez squirms out of a couple of challenges in midfield with some neat control. His performance will be key if Boro are to get a result today. 2 min: Barragan does well to hold off Hazard, who is making his 150th Premier League appearance here, earning a free after the Belgian nudges him on the back while shielding the ball. 1 min: We are underway. Boro get going, playing from right to left as we watch. We will kick-off after a moment of silence that ends up turning into applause for Remembrance Sunday. Nobody at all is wearing a poppy – who’s ready to fume at this lack of respect? The teams are out. The lightshow (!) is done with and we are moments away from some hot! hot! hot! Premier League football action. Middlesbrough are in red, as you’d expect, and Chelsea are in their black and yellow change strip. “Every game is a challenge for us,” says Aitor Karanka on TV. “It’s important to think and play our football and win,” believes Antonio Conte. More of these hot takes as we get them. Chelsea’s last game, that thumping of Everton, was perhaps the most one-sided of the season so far. And ominously for Boro they are unchanged. The hosts, meanwhile, have made two swaps from the draw at City: Fabio Da Silva replaces George Friend at left-back, and Gaston Ramírez is back from suspension, meaning Stewart Downing drops to the bench. A question for the floor: what’s the least appealing fixture in the Premier League? Of course not this one, but looking at West Brom v Burnley tomorrow night, there aren’t many less exciting for neutrals than that … Email me: alan.smith@theguardian.com, or sum it up in fewer than 140 characters by making a tweet to @alansmith90. Middlesbrough: Valdes; Barragan, Chambers, Gibson, Da Silva; Traore, Forshaw, Clayton, De Roon, Ramirez; Negredo. Subs: Guzan, Espinosa, Fischer, Nsue, Leadbitter, Downing, Rhodes. Chelsea: Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Diego Costa, Hazard. Subs: Begovic, Ivanovic, Terry, Chalobah, Fabregas, Oscar, Batshuayi. Remember that Saturday evening in late September when Chelsea were brutally dismantled by Arsenal and it seemed that Antonio Conte had more work than initially bargained for to return them to title challengers? Yeah, well since then Chelsea have won every game to an aggregate score of 16-0. A sixth victory in a row here would move them top of the table, a point clear of Manchester City and Liverpool. Early days and all that, but they have the look of contenders. Middlesbrough should not be completely discounted this afternoon, though. They have stifled both Arsenal and City in recent weeks to earn draws and have also beaten Bournemouth at home, although the head to head record makes for grim reading. Not only have Chelsea won the past half dozen meetings but it is more than a decade since Boro last scored in this fixture – Mark Viduka finding the net in a 2-1 win in August 2006. (Obvious caveat: today’s hosts have spent much of that period in the second tier). Chelsea’s run has largely been put down to a change in system but there have been more notable facets. Certainly the switch to a three-man defence has been a boost and Conte says “I’m surprised at the speed to understand this new change”, but one cannot underplay that Chelsea are a team again and the star players are locked in and engaged. In particular Eden Hazard, who is close to the irresistible form he was in the season before last. “You can see Eden is always involved in the game, not calm and off during the game. No, he always stays in the game and he’s always a point of reference for his team-mates,” Conte says of the Belgian. Will he be decisive here? Kick-off at the Riverside is 4pm GMT. Team news follows imminently. Meantime, why not read Dominic Fifield’s exclusive interview with Eden Hazard.\n",
      "Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea and more: football clockwatch – as it happened That’s it from me, thanks for reading and emailing from all corners of the world, sorry I couldn’t use them all. Now why not follow Leicester receiving the Premier League trophy? Gregg Bakowski has it live, right here. Bye! The Newcastle manager, Rafa Benítez: “Really disappointed, not just because of three points but also Sunderland. Now we have to wait. We have to wait, see what they do in the week, and after try to win our game. We were not comfortable in possession, we had some good chances but at this level and when you need points you have to take your chances, and we didn’t do it.” Match report: West Ham 1-4 Swansea Match report: Crystal Palace 2-1 Stoke Match report: Bournemouth 1-1 West Brom Match report: Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea The Sunderland manager, Sam Allardyce: “Extraordinary. Nerve-racking. Wonderful goal from Wahbi to thrill the whole of the stadium. (I said) ‘let’s not waste Whabi’s goal’. It’s a wonderful result for us. One thing we do know is that it’s in our hands. Hopefully we can achieve our goal on Wednesday night [against Everton]. Since the turn of the year we’ve been so near yet so far from so many victories, yet today we’ve come back to a winning position twice.” That late John Terry red card could spell a miserable end to his trophy-laden Chelsea career, should he leave in the summer. Terry will receive a two-match ban, having been sent off earlier in the season already, and of course Chelsea have only two games remaining. He threw his armband to the floor when he realised what he’d done. Sunderland’s Jermain Defoe: “Goosebumps. Unbelievable. It’s been like that all season. The fans have been fantastic. A difficult game but obviously we managed to do it against a top Chelsea team who won the league last year.” That result sends Sunderland out of the bottom three, a point clear of Newcastle with a game in hand. Sunderland are in the box seat and would seal safety with a win on Wednesday night against Everton. The picture now looks very bleak for Norwich, however, and their race is almost run. Premier League table Premier League results Norwich 0-1 Man Utd West Ham 1-4 Swansea Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea Bournemouth 1-1 West Brom Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle Crystal Palace 2-1 Stoke Wow. A stunning strike by Khazri before a quickfire double by Defoe and Borini have handed Sunderland the most crucial of crucial wins. Oxford see off Wycombe 3-0 and Bristol Rovers strike late to win 2-1 against Dagenham and secure back-to-back promotions. Accrington will have to do it through the play-offs. A second yellow and the Chelsea captain is off. Bafetimbi Gomis adds a bit of gloss and West Ham have been humbled at Upton Park. That is surely the end of their top-four chase. Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle This looks like being a major slip-up for Newcastle. Follow it live right here. “My location is about as far from exotic as you can get,” emails Jeremy Morris. “I’m in seat 8F on American Airlines flight 2980, 29,000 feet over the Arizona desert. Nice view though. If you’ve nothing better to do, go to FlightAware.com and you can track progress to New York.” Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea Nothing came of that Chelsea free-kick as you might have guessed and Sunderland are into injury time here – so close. League Two – Huge goal! Bristol Rovers strike! They go 2-1 up through Lee Brown’s injury-time goal, and it means Accrington have to score in the remaining few seconds or they will bumped down into the play-offs. Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea Free-kick to Chelsea in a dangerous position... League Two Accrington hit the bar! They might not need it but that would have secured their place in League One next season. Still 0-0 against Stevenage. Sunderland 3-2 Chelsea Five minutes for Sunderland to hold on, and holding on is exactly what they are doing. No fourth goal on the cards, Big Sam is shutting up shop. League Two Accrington are struggling to make that crucial breakthrough against Stevenage, likewise Bristol Rovers who are desperate for that goal against Dagenham that would send them up. Both still drawing with around five minutes to go. Matt Ritchie puts Bournemouth level and these two are going to go into the final weekend of the season locked together on 42 points, it seems. An incredible array of exotic and not-so locations emailed, and plenty of suspicion about whether Hugo really has a girlfriend. Unfortunately I can’t roll them all out because of the football that’s happening, but here’s one from Nicholas Brown: “Taking shelter in a little Hurricane Hole in the ‘Paradise Lakes’ Great Sound, Bermuda on my 40’ liveaboard. It’s blowing near gale force and pissing rain and has been for 2 days. All on my lonesome with just the turtles for company. Glad of the distraction of EPL. Bet the weather’s better there!!” Tis lovely. League Two Oxford United have a second against Wycombe through a Chris Maguire penalty and they are just 15 minutes from sealing promotion to League One. Bristol Rovers still need a goal to deny Accrington Stanley the other automatic promotion spot. A great effort from Dortmund falls short after a surprise defeat to Frankfurt, and Bayern are champions for the fourth season in a row. How about this. Jermain Dofoe grabs Sunderland’s second in three minutes and Sunderland, as it stands, are out of the bottom three. Incredible. Equaliser! Wait, there’s more... Palace have turned this game on its head and it’s that man Dwight Gayle again. Fabianski makes a brilliant double save but can’t keep out the third as Sakho’s effort goes in off Kingsley, and the Hammers may be back in it. Scottish Premiership Kris Doolan grabs Partick’s second and it looks as though Kilmarnock will have to settle for the relegation play-off. Sunderland 1-2 Chelsea Cattermole and Costa both miss decent chances, Mannone making a fine stop to deny the latter. “Keeping up with the Sunderland game from my girlfriend’s house,” Hugo Campbell. “Nowhere particularly special, it’s just in Greenwich, but I just wanted everyone to know that I’ve got a girlfriend.” Bundesliga Karim Onisiwo makes it 3-1 to Mainz and it looks like Stuttgart are moving a step closer to the drop. Michael Collins emails with an important point on book-based etiquette: “Donuts? In a library? It’s the end of days.” League Two Chey Dunkley’s bullet header has sent Oxford fans crazy – they are heading to League One if they can hold on to this 1-0 advantage against Wycombe. Bristol Rovers need a goal of their own against Dagenham & Redbridge if they are to seal back-to-back promotions this afternoon. Scottish Premiership “Is it possible to add Dundee to your list of exotic reading locations?” chances Simon McMahon. “The climate is sub-arctic, and there’s certainly a lot of wildlife here. Looking good for Hamilton and Partick, who both lead, leaving Kilmarnock to take their chances in the relegation play off.” Well, well, well. Well. Barrow whips a cross from the left and Ki slams a classy volley home. Hard to know if people are just making these up now: “Watching Chelsea from a bungalow at a Mauritian fisherman village,” emails Gaurav Pandit, “and feeling that Sunderland should be rewarded better for their enterprise and effort.” This is a very Yannick Bolasie assist, charging 30 yards with the ball stuck to his feet before losing control at the crucial moment, but it ran nicely for Dwight Gayle to fire Palace level. Light reading If you are the sort who only calls in on the Championship to find out who the teams promoted to the Premier League are, then here are some match reports just for you: “Your ‘great range of exotic reading locations this afternoon’ also includes the law library at the University of Tennessee,” toots Claire Tuley, “where I am rooting for Sunderland (actually an Arsenal fan, but they’re my nephew’s team and I’d hate to see them relegated), eating donuts, and attempting to learn the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So, so exotic and glamourous.” Don’t put yourself down, Claire. It’s below Tibetan rafting but a library in Tennessee is still a notch above Towers in the glamour league system, I think. And you have donuts. Adam Hirst emails: “The way Villa v Newcastle is going, that Norwich v United match earlier is somehow not even going to be the dullest match of the day. If you can stay awake til 5pm, you’ll have earned your money today.” League Two Oxford, Accrington and Bristol Rovers are all drawing at the break, which means Rovers would be the side to miss out on automatic promotion as it stands. It’s set up for some spectacular late heartbreak, you feel. Half-time whistles are blowing all over the UK. Here are the scores at the break in the Premier League: West Ham 0-2 Swansea Sunderland 1-2 Chelsea Bournemouth 0-1 West Brom Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle Crystal Palace 0-1 Stoke And you can get all the latest scores across Europe right here. Oh dear. So soon after that wonderful Khazri equaliser, Nemanja Matic has restored Chelsea’s lead. A brutal blow for the home side just before the break. “Big L,” emails Ciaran Gill. Lovely start. “Currently on a rooftop in Jaisalmer, India, in a Tibetan restaurant with a couple of frosty Kingfishers. Eagerly awaiting some good news re Sunderland - don’t let us down!” Your wish has already been granted, I think. A great range of exotic reading locations this afternoon. Artur Boruc pulls off a fine double save to deny Craig Gardner’s penalty and the rebound, and keep Bournemouth in it. The Baggies aren’t having much luck from the spot in recent weeks. Footage of that Khazri goal just in: Wahbi Khazri has just scored an utter stunner to bring Sunderland level. What a massive moment in the relegation battle this may or may not be. Bayern Munich’s English arm is still finding its tone on Twitter, I feel: Bundesliga Second halves under way in Germany. Frankfurt still lead Dortmund 1-0 where a surprise win could pull them out of the relegation scrap. Scottish Premiership Only two goals in the Scottish Premiership so far: Scott McDonald handed Motherwell the lead against St Johnstone and Carlton Morris has scored for Hamilton against Dundee. It’s a wonderful assist by 21-year-old Stephen Kingsley who feeds Andre Ayew in thre box and the forward can’t miss. Shouldn’t Swansea be on the proverbial beach? West Ham’s Champions League aspirations are hanging by a thread. A lovely goal by the visitors, Charlie Adam arriving in the box and sweeping home with his right foot, which is almost certainly the first time it’s touched a ball this season. First Payet goes very close with one of his trademark free-kicks, before Swansea go on the attack. Naughton volleys the ball across the goal and Wayne Routledge is on hand to tap home at the back post. Crystal Palace 0-0 Stoke Xherdan Shaqiri runs in on goal but misses his one-on-one, Wayne Hennessey saving well with his feet. Lots of action at Selhurst but no goals so far. “Also very, very nervous here in Nepal up near the Tibetan border where we are rafting the Bhote Kosi,” emails John Davis. “Relying on intermittent mobile data connection and your reports to keep in touch with Newcastle’s score. My wife is a mackem, so it is a tense state of affairs.” This sounds like a recipe for a drowned mobile phone, surely? League Two Back to the battle for promotion and Billy Bodin has equalised for Bristol Rovers to quickly cancel out Dagenham & Redbridge’s opener. The League winners, Northampton, are up against Portsmouth through a Jack Whatmough own goal. Pompey have rested plenty of players today ahead of the play-offs. Salomón Rondón gets up well in the box to power a header past Artur Boruc, and the visitors are in front. Cahill’s deflected shot finds its way to Diego Costa who fires home from close range. A roar goes in a corner of Villa Park. League Two Hmm, did I say Bristol Rovers have the easiest game of the promotion chasers? Well they are behind against Dagenham & Redbridge, Matthew Cash slotting home for the visitors. A massive boost for Accrington Stanley and Oxford United, who are going up as it stands. Crystal Palace 0-0 Stoke It’s been an entertaining start at Selhurst Park and Palace might have had an early penalty – Dwight Gayle went down right on the edge of the box but won only a free-kick. League Two Bristol Rovers require a win and a mistake from either Oxford United or Accrington Stanley to be promoted automatically, but they have the easiest fixture on paper with a home tie against relegated Dagenham and Redbridge. All three matches are goalless so far. “Nerves, nerves and more nerves here in Beijing,” emails Richard Wood, who I deduce is a Bristol Rovers fan. “We have had a fantastic season - this time last year we were in the Conference Playoffs and maybe in three hours we will be in the League Two playoffs - but a result today and a failure for Oxford or Accrington would be perfect. Up The Gas.” Bundesliga Stefan Aigner’s 14th-minute strike has handed Frankfurt a 1-0 lead against Dortmund. At Ingolstadt, Thomas Müller has handed penalty duties to Robert Lewandowski following his miss against Atlético Madrid, and the striker has slotted Bayern into a 1-0 advantage. Bundesliga table Premier League Whistles peep as the five 1500 BST kick-offs get under way. Perhaps not £170m but I take Gary’s point. I always like a club who come up and gives the players who earned it their chance. Juan Mata’s second-half goal has pushed Norwich closer to the Championship. The Canaries now desperately need favours from Chelsea and Aston Villa this afternoon. Get the details here. Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: “I could not be more proud of this group of players. Thank you, it’s amazing for me. It was impossible (to relax). Sometimes they said I was crazy when I said we could put this club in the Premier League again, but two years later we’ve done it.” Middlesbrough midfielder Adam Clayton speaks from a bouncing Boro dressing room: “Personally for me and my dad to finally get back up there it’s been a personal mission, it has been incredible. This is a Premier League club, and now it is in the Premier League. We’ll have a good two months off, then we’ll come back and try and do a Leicester eh.” That was said with a cheeky grin, I should say. Rafa Benítez speaks: “They [the Newcastle players] are running a lot. I can see the belief every time that we win. When they get the result they fight even more for the next game.” Premier League Norwich are running out of time to get something from their match against Manchester United, where it’s still 1-0 thanks to Juan Mata’s second-half strike. You can follow the finish to that one here, and the buildup to Aston Villa v Newcastle here. A beleaguered Simon McMahon emails from Scotland: “Afternoon Lawrence. I’ll be honest, I struggled to motivate myself to write this week’s Scottish football update. But, you know, the show must go on etc etc. Hibs have just beaten Raith 2-0 and so overturn their first leg defeat and progress to the play off semi against Falkirk. The winners of that will most likely face Kilmarnock for a place in the SPL after Dundee United’s inevitable relegation was confirmed on Monday. United restored a little pride (not really, though) with a 3-2 win at Inverness last night as they prepare for life in the Scottish Championship. “A win for Kilmarnock against Partick today though would make things interesting as far as the play-off place is concerned. Elsewhere it’s play-off time all round as teams across Scotland fight to stay in or move up a league. Ayr and Stranraer have healthy first leg leads against Peterhead and Livingston and should progress. It’s not so clear cut as Cowdenbeath host Queens Park and Elgin play Clyde. And Edinburgh City are looking to end East Stirling’s 61 year stay in the senior leagues as they host the first leg of the League Two play off. Right, I’m off for a lie down.” Match report: Middlesbrough 1-1 Brighton Championship Most of the full-time scores from England’s second tier are in and you can check them all here. They’ve done it, and Brighton will have to go through the play-offs if they are to join Boro and Burnley in the top flight. Get the details here with Gregg Bakowski. Championship Hull have finished the regular season with a flourish, smashing five past Rotherham with Jake Livermore twice on the scoresheet in a 5-1 win. Hull head into the playoffs next where they will play Derby. Still a couple of minutes left of the eight added at Boro where it’s 1-1 – their fans are lining up ominously on the advertising hoardings for a full-scale pitch invasion. The stewards have no chance. Follow it here. There hasn’t been an awful lot more than pride to play for elsewhere in England’s second tier, something Charlton haven’t managed to salvage much of with a 3-0 home bashing by Burnley, who win the league in the process. Sam Vokes, George Boyd, and Andre Gray did the damage in south London. Hats off to a team who came down from the Premier League and stuck by their manager, Sean Dyche. A fantastic achievement. Disaster for Norwich – get the skinny right here with Barry Glendenning. It’s worth just the £170m: Championship It’s the final ten minutes of the Championship’s regular season and Middlesbrough are clinging on to an automatic promotion place. You can follow Brighton throwing the kitchen sink at Boro right here, with Gregg Bakowski. In a week best summed up by a slow-motion video of Wes Morgan sliding on his back across Jamie Vardy’s kitchen floor, it is easy to forget there is still plenty to settle below Leicester in the Premier League table. Sunderland host a Chelsea side fresh from the Stamford Bridge brawl with Tottenham which sealed Leicester’s title. It is hard to know whether the Blues will be inspired or insipid after that game but the Black Cats, 18th and one point behind Newcastle with a game in hand, are in desperate need of the latter. Newcastle go to Aston Villa knowing anything but a win will mean points dropped, while Norwich are already in action with Manchester United – you can follow the end of that game here. West Ham play Swansea in their penultimate match at Upton Park with a Champions League spot still within reach, while Crystal Palace host on-their-holidays Stoke for the chance to make their safety official. And Bournemouth play West Brom at the Vitality Stadium, two teams each with a totally opposing ethos locked together on 41 points. It doesn’t matter how you get there, I suppose. Premier League table Elsewhere, League Two wraps up with a tasty fight for the right to be automatically promoted alongside Northampton: Accrington Stanley, Oxford United and Bristol Rovers are chasing the two remaining spots. There is also a busy schedule of Bundesliga games to keep an eye on and lots of action in Scotland too, so don’t go anywhere! No really, I need the company: if you’d like to send me an email or a tweet, that would be lovely. League Two table\n",
      "TechCrunch falls victim to OurMine hacking group Verizon-owned prominent technology site TechCrunch has become the latest victim of the OurMine hacking group. OurMine Security appeared to gain publishing access to the site, which uses the popular content management system Wordpress, and posted its now infamous message. A post on the site under the byline of Seattle-based writer Devin Coldewey said: “Hello Guys, don’t worry we are just testing techcrunch security, we didn’t change any passwords, please contact us.” The post was then promoted as a ticker, the top banner in red and a the main story on TechCrunch’s front page. The OurMine posting appeared at around 12.20pm BST (7.20am ET) but was removed within two hours. It was still showing in Google’s index and cache at the time of writing. The attack on the technology site is latest in a number of high-profile compromises by OurMine, which included the social media accounts of Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google boss Sundar Pichai. OurMine also claimed responsibility last week for a DDoS attack on Pokémon Go’s servers. The TechCrunch attack appears to have leveraged a contributor’s account, rather than a hack on the site’s Wordpress system. In previous attacks, OurMine has used weaker linked accounts to post to services such as Twitter, rather than taking over the user’s social media accounts directly.

      "Swansea City 1-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened And now, read Stuart James’s on-the-whistle match report from the Liberty Stadium here: And if you want more football, Barry Glendenning is your man. Liverpool move up to second in the table. They started poorly but the injury to Adam Lallana forced a reshuffle, and moving Philippe Coutinho into midfield sparked them into life. They were deserved winners after completely dominating the last hour of the game. Swansea put in an admirable shift and will reflect on two great chances that were missed by Borja Baston in the first half, and that last-minute sitter for Mike van der Hoorn. Thanks for your company; bye! 90+3 min What a chance for van der Hoorn! I would have scored that*. It was a great cross from the right by Rangel that curled and dipped over the head of the Liverpool centre-backs. It came to van der Hoorn, eight yards out, and he screwed a feeble volley wide of the far post. (* Legal disclaimer: I may not actually have scored that.) 90 min There will be four added minutes. 89 min Can’s low cross is almost put into his own net by the weary Cork. Fabianski gets down to his left to save. 89 min It will be ridiculous if Francesco Guidolin is sacked after this game. 88 min This is over. Swansea have nothing left in the tank. 86 min Origi has an instant impact with a low cross from the right towards the unmarked Sturridge. He can’t reach it on the stretch but Coutinho backs up the play beyond the far post to batter a shot from a tight angle that is beaten away by Fabianski. 85 min A double change for Liverpool: Can and Origi replace Wijnaldum and Firmino. James Milner scores confidently, clipping it straight down the middle as Fabianski goes to the right. Oh, this is a nightmare for Swansea. Barrow, in his own box, blooters his attempted clearance straight up in the air, and when it bounces Rangel panicks and shoves Firmino to the ground. A clear penalty, and a pretty needless one. 82 min The Swansea players, it is fair to assume, do not want Francesco Guidolin to be sacked. Their endeavour in this half has verged on the heroic. 81 min Coutinho’s long-range shot deflects behind for a corner. Matip’s near-post header deflects behind for a second corner on the right, which will again be taken by Henderson. It’s a dangerous outswinger that somehow evades everyone on the six-yard line. 78 min This is Swansea’s best spell since around the half-hour mark, and for the time being they look the likelier scorers. 77 min Francesco Guidolin’s substitutions have given Swansea greater energy, and as a result the last 10 minutes have been less fraught. They almost take the lead when Karius comes for a left-wing corner and gets nowhere near it, with the ball flashing right across the face of goal. 75 min A rare Swansea attack, with a nice run and cross from Barrow leading to a corner. Sigurdsson takes it and Milner heads clear. 72 min Swansea’s final substitution: Leroy Fer is replaced by Jay Fulton. 72 min Swansea can put two passes together, but three is a stretch and the ball is always coming back at them. 70 min From the resulting corner, Sturridge flashes a header a few yards wide of the far post. 69 min The dithering van der Hoorn is robbed on the edge of the area by Milner. He slightly overhits his pass to Mane, who gets it out of his feet nonetheless and hits a shot that is deflected over the bar by Naughton. 68 min Clyne, who has been a constant attacking threat, cracks a low shot from 25 yards that is well held by Fabianski. 67 min Mane shrieks with pain after a tackle by Ki, and the replays shows why: he planted his studs into Mane’s right foot. 64 min Coutinho bundles Barrow to the ground to launch a Liverpool counter-attack. Firmino plays the ball down the left to Coutinho, whose excellent low cross just evades Sturridge at the near post. 63 min Another Swansea change: Ki Sung-Yueng replaces the tiring captain Leon Britton. 62 min Swansea make their first change, with Modou Barrow replacing Wayne Routledge. 59 min Swansea surely can’t do this for another half an hour. They are under constant pressure. 57 min Swansea are struggling to stay in this game. Coutinho plays a one-two with Mane and places a beautiful curler just wide from inside the D. He has been terrific since dropping into midfield. Liverpool are level! Coutinho’s free-kick hits the wall and comes to Henderson, who lobs it first time into the box. Firmino, who stayed onside as Swansea pushed up, places a good header into the left corner of the net from 10 yards. 54 min Britton is booked for a cynical pull on Mane, 25 yards from goal. 52 min It’s raining heavily now, which adds to the increasingly desperate feel of the match as Liverpool chase an equaliser in a manner usually reserved for the last 10 minutes. 48 min Mane combines with Sturridge – who should have been flagged offside - and clips the ball past the outrushing Fabianski from the right corner of the six-yard box. It deflects off van der Hoorn and rolls invitingly in front of goal before Amat boots it clear. 47 min Clyne runs at Naughton and crosses low towards Sturridge, who spins Amat at the near post but overruns the ball in doing so. Goal kick to Swansea. 46 min Swansea begin the second half, kicking from left to right. Half-time cheer “Travelling from west Wales to Cardiff, I got stuck in match-day traffic in torrential rain on the M4 earlier, so this match put me in a bad mood before it had even kicked off,” says Matt Dony. “Checking the half-time score hasn’t helped. Batter Arsenal, lose to Burnley. Batter Chelsea, losing to Swansea. Gotta love being a Liverpool fan.” They’ll win this 3-1. You have my word. Half-time reading A fine 45 minutes for Swansea, who could be 3-0 ahead, though the way Liverpool came to life towards half-time was pretty ominous. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 44 min Sigurdsson’s dipping free-kick is fumbled by Karius but he claims it comfortably at the second attempt. 43 min Swansea really, really need half-time. A breather is the next-best thing, and Britton provides that by craftily drawing a foul from Matip 30 yards from the Liverpool goal. 42 min Another corner for Liverpool, who have stirred menacingly in the last 10 minutes. Henderson’s outswinger reaches Lovren, who miscontrols it perfectly for Firmino. He shoots on the turn from six yards but Fer takes the sting out of the shot and it dribbles through to Fabianski. 40 min After a classy through pass from Coutinho, Amat makes a wonderful tackle to block Mane’s first-time shot. 39 min Sturridge is booked for diving in the Swansea area. He was challenged by Routledge, who put hands on him but not very firmly. Jurgen Klopp has his hands over his mouth in surprise, but I think that was probably the right decision. 38 min Cork is booked for a lunge at Clyne. This is Liverpool’s best spell of pressure. 35 min The overlapping Clyne wins a corner for Liverpool. It’s taken by Henderson and reaches Lovren, whose stabbed volley on the stretch is blocked by a defender on the six-yard line. 32 min Liverpool have been a bit better since Coutinho moved into midfield but their play is still relatively ponderous. 29 min Mane does brilliantly to wriggle away from two defenders inside the box and then goes over after a bit of a shove from van der Hoorn. Michael Oliver doesn’t give a penalty, and you can understand why as the contact was relatively light, but it was risky defending from van der Hoorn. 28 min In other news, you should watch this. 26 min From the resulting free-kick, curled in magnificently from a narrow position on the right by Sigurdsson, Borja plants a great headed chance wide of the post. He was actually offside, though the flag didn’t go up, and in that sense Liverpool are lucky not to be 3-0 down here. 25 min Liverpool are not playing well at all. Swansea are beating them at their own gegenpress. Cork is tripped by Henderson, who is booked. 23 min Lallana has a groin injury apparently, and Daniel Sturridge comes on to replace him. Coutinho goes into midfield, Firmino to the left and Sturridge up front. I love the smell of tactics in the morning. 21 min Sigurdsson floats a high, dainty ball over the top of the Liverpool defence to find Cork, who slides forward and helps the ball towards goal as it drops over his shoulder inside the box. He can’t get any pace on it, however, and it’s a comfortable save from Karius. 20 min Lallana is struggling after a tackle from Britton. It looked innocuous but I don’t think he’ll be able to continue. 16 min “I don’t think Fer was offside either,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “Besides, any team that leaves two men unmarked at its far post deserves to be scored on, just on moral and ethical grounds.” I like this idea of adding a moral dimension to officiating. Like in cricket, where batsmen who pad up are more likely to be given out LBW as punishment for bad batsmanship. 14 min Liverpool have been a bit sloppy and sluggish. Firmino is robbed 30 yards from his own goal by Fer, who smashes a shot over the bar. 10 min The more you see the replays, the more it looks like the touch came from Lovren, so the goal was fine. Fer was not offside from the original header by Borja. 9 min “The game isn’t at Anfield,” says Chris Rendle, “but it’s always nice to bust out the video of the Swansea supporter scoring at Anfield.” It was a simple goal for Swansea. Sigurdssn’s swung a left-wing corner beyond the far post to Borja, who strained his neck muscles like Bruce Banner to head it down into the six-yard box. Van der Hoorn stretched to stab it past Karius, and although it was going in anyway, Leroy Fer did a Craig Johnston and whacked it in from 0.5 yards. I thought Fer looked fractionally offside but there is a suggestion the touch came from Lovren rather than van der Hoorn. Klopp out! 5 min The first chance falls to Swansea. Routledge on the right curls a lovely cross over the head of Matip to find the unmarked Borja, who heads over from six yards. He should have scored. 4 min “Extraordinary clip of Dai Davies sticking the boot in on Terry Mac,” says Gary Naylor. “In front of the Kop, what could have prompted the ex-Everton man to such aggression?” Graeme Souness’s attempt to mediate is also a joy. 3 min Liverpool have started with lots of possession, if not yet progression. 2 min “Dear Rob and Hubert,” says Paul Ewart, “when will hipsters stop being a thing?” At last, someone on my wavelength. I got a machete for my birthday and I reckon we can complete Operation Hipstercide by 2032. Wait, hang on. “Good test for the Reds this: are we Jurgen’s new, vibrant, confident Reds as I suspect, or do we still have our demons......” 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool, in red, kick off from left to right. Swansea are all white on the afternoon. Another email! “Good afternoon Rob,” says Dean Kinsella. “I can’t believe that Guidolin is already under pressure for his job after just a handful of games. The Swans have had some tough fixtures and starting to play well after a slow start. This ‘in out in out shake it all about’ way of running football clubs is ludicrous.” Yep. Like too much of modern football, it’s beneath contempt. Ron Atkinson made a great point in his new autobiography (which is superb, by the way), that if Arsene Wenger was a businessman, he’d win awards every year. There’s a broader point that business standards should apply to certain aspects of football, and sacking managers at the first sign of trouble is appallingly bad practice. Thirty-five years ago this weekend, newly promoted Swansea drew 2-2 at Anfield. The goalkeeper Dai Davies didn’t take Terry McDermott’s equaliser too well. An email! “Hello Rob,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “Today will be the perfect test for Liverpool as this is just the sort of match that has binned our previous false dawns. Swansea is at home, its manager desperate, and they have the style and the players that can break the hipsters’ beloved gegenpresse. A title is one via two mini-leagues: take 2/3 of the points available from the other 5 or 6 contenders and pretenders; and be a brutal flat track bully to the other dozen teams. Burnley was a stumble. Now, was it motivation or the hint of things to come? Today we get our first indication.” That last point is a particularly good one. There was one season, 2008/09 I think, when Manchester United took 70 out of 72 points against the bottom 12. The champions are often the team that deals best with the mundane. Swansea (4-3-3) Fabianski; Rangel, van der Hoorn, Amat, Naughton; Fer, Cork, Britton; Routledge, Borja, Sigurdsson. Substitutes: Nordfeldt, Mawson, Taylor, Fulton, Ki, Barrow, McBurnie. Liverpool (4-3-3) Karius; Clyne, Lovren, Matip, Milner; Lallana, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Mane, Firmino, Coutinho. Substitutes: Mignolet, Sturridge, Klavan, Moreno, Lucas, Can, Origi. Liverpool are fifth in the table. What’s the rumpus? The rumpus is that they’ve already won at Chelsea and Arsenal, outplayed Spurs at White Hart Lane and scored 16 goals in six games. It’s hard to know whether they are serious title contenders, because we can’t be sure what impact their flawed defence will have over a whole season, but we can say without fear of contradiction from tryhard blowhards on the internet that they have an attack capable of winning the title. They also have the huge advantage of not being in Europe – just as in 2013-14, when they should have won their first title since 1989-90 - and a manager who, even in this season of the Premier League supersupersupermanager, is rapidly becoming the neutral’s favourite. In some ways, talk of them winning the title is unnecessary. It’s October. Relax everyone, can we? This Liverpool side are a reminder that football can and should be fun. Swansea is not an easy place to go – they drew against Chelsea and were excellent against Manchester City last week - but you would fancy Liverpool to have more fun today. Kick off is at 12.30pm. Hello. Rob will be along shortly. Here’s Alan Smith’s preview of the lunchtime kick-off: Swansea performed well in defeat to Manchester City last weekend but Francesco Guidolin is still living on borrowed time. The Italian could badly do with a result against Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, who have at times been exhilarating in attack. Guidolin says he could “maybe” lose his job with another loss but “if we win, for the international break you don’t speak any more about my position”. No pressure, then.\n",
      "Georginio Wijnaldum gives Liverpool deserved win against Manchester City These are the moments when Liverpool’s supporters must hold genuine hope their team are capable of catching and overhauling Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table. There is still a six-point deficit but Jürgen Klopp’s men look absolutely convinced they have what it takes and it was not a coincidence that the man in charge of the music belted out an old Starship track straight after the final whistle. Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now felt like an accurate gauge of the mood. Anfield was certainly a happy place because Liverpool not only signalled their intentions here but blew a gaping hole in the title chances on another of the teams who began the season with lofty ambitions. Georginio Wijnaldum’s goal inflicted the damage and the 10-match winning sequence with which Pep Guardiola introduced himself at Manchester City is starting to feel like a deception. This was another erratic display and, however it is dressed up, City’s owners did not bring in Guardiola to be 10 points adrift at the halfway point of the season. Liverpool played with great panache at times and, in other periods, they showed the kind of durability that will be essential to sustain a title challenge. The players in red never gave their opponents a moment’s peace in the first half but after the break, when they switched to a more conservative system, they can also take great encouragement from the fact City had lots of the ball but did not create one clear opportunity. What never shifted was the impeccable attitude of Liverpool’s players whereas their opponents, in contrast, took an age to get going. Once the visiting team started showing some urgency, with Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne growing into the game, they did at least make a fight of it. Yet it would be generous to say they deserved anything considering the story of the 90 minutes and, once again, they came away from Anfield filled with regret. They have not won here since 2003 and Sergio Agüero has not scored at this ground in eight appearances. The Argentinian, back from a four-match suspension, barely got a sniff. Klopp’s men scored 87 league goals in 2016, their highest figure since managing the same in 1985. More importantly, there was hard evidence here that if any team can chase down Chelsea it is likely to be the one with the liver bird on their chest. At one point Roberto Firmino could be seen miscontrolling the ball to concede a throw-in and there was still warm applause. There is a vibe here reminiscent of the near-victorious season now infamous for Steven Gerrard’s slip. The crowd can see a team who are giving everything and, in their latest victory, a set of players who looked desperate to show their superiority. For long spells, they did exactly that – quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and playing in the knowledge that if City’s defence are placed under pressure a mistake will generally follow. City have kept only four clean sheets from their 19 league fixtures in the Guardiola era and Aleksandar Kolarov, in particular, had a difficult match. There is nothing particularly new about that but it was rare to see City look so incoherent in attack, particularly in the opening 45 minutes when Sterling, facing his former club, seemed disorientated by the crowd’s jeers and even Silva, of all people, could be seen misplacing relatively simple passes. Sterling’s early anxiety disappeared in the second half when he started reminding his old club of his threat. Yet Liverpool, holding on to their early lead and switching to a counterattacking system, still looked the more threatening side, albeit with less of the ball. Perhaps the best compliment that can be paid to Wijnaldum for his goal is that there are Liverpool supporters of a certain generation who will remember John Toshack scoring headers of this nature. It was a prodigious leap but, more than anything, it was the sheer will on his part to meet Adam Lallana’s cross with the necessary blend of power and precision. The ball flashed past Claudio Bravo and Liverpool had scored for the 23rd successive top-division fixture on their own ground. City had an argument that Ragnar Klavan, already booked for a challenge on Agüero, might have been shown a second yellow card shortly before the goal. Yet any grievance on their part does not alter the fact they made an almighty mess of the free-kick, leading directly to the game’s decisive moment. Yaya Touré’s decision to aim it out to the left wing was strange in itself and Kolarov’s touch to give the ball away was clumsy in the extreme. City were vulnerable as soon as Firmino played the initial forward pass, giving Lallana the chance to make ground on the left, and Kolarov’s ignominy was compounded by the fact that when he made it back to the penalty area he was the player Wijnaldum out-jumped. That Kolarov was at fault twice probably summed up his evening. It was not until the game was approaching the hour-mark that Guardiola’s team started to pass the ball with speed and clarity. Silva and De Bruyne switched positions and both became increasingly influential. Yet whatever Guardiola is trying is not working. Not yet anyway. Liverpool were barely troubled during four minutes of stoppage time and the game finished with Klopp embracing his players, blowing kisses to the crowd and looking forward to 2017.\n",
      "Puro Instinct: Autodrama review – dangerous dreampop LA sisters Piper Durabo and Skylar Cielo made, in 2011’s Headbangers in Ecstasy, the bloggiest of all blog band albums. Their second takes its template – hazy dreampop, synth haze, slightly gothic guitar – and explores a darker Hollywood delirium. On Peccavi and Tell Me there are hints of Madonna’s early pep, but dreamy and dissipated, with Durabo intoning about “wishing fiction into fact” and urging you to “forget about tomorrow”. LA’s mystical side surfaces in Six of Swords, Scorpio Rising and the title track’s sample of the occultist Manly P Hall, while End of an Era introduces an anti-war sentiment and a delicious, doomy lassitude. If the songwriting isn’t always the match of the sheen, the best moments here – Panarchy, What You See, Autodrama – are dangerously seductive.\n",
      "Let’s Eat Grandma review – frighteningly inventive duo rip up girl-group cliches From their ominous name to the impudent, blank expressions they wear, Let’s Eat Grandma don’t just eschew girl-group stereotypes – they rip them to shreds with fiendish delight. Formed by friends Jenny Hollingworth, 17, and Rosa Walton, 16, LEG provide a dazzling, befuddling glimpse into teenage life as expressed through dark-edged fantasies and experimental pop. The duo, who share an uncanny physical and saccharine-sweet vocal similarity, amp up the weird factor with spooky synths and eerie recorders. Shrouded in black, barricaded on stage by a bank of keyboards and hidden behind curtains of long wavy hair, it’s almost impossible to tell them apart. Facing one another for the vigorous hand-clapping intro of Deep Six Textbook, they resemble baby-faced versions of pre-Raphaelite heroine Elizabeth Siddal. But, as they bend forward, then slowly rise up to face the crowd, there’s something of The Shining’s scary Grady twins about the pair. The thing most frightening about their music, however, is its sheer inventiveness. The frustration of schoolwork is vented against hymn-like, humming synths and a soulful saxophone, the story of Rapunzel is sung by Walton with vengeful sweetness, while Hollingworth plays an accusatory rhythm on drums with lashings of cymbal. Both girls move between their instruments – which include lead guitar and glockenspiel – with practised ease and, having formed the band in 2013, the songs are played with tight abandon. It’s when LEG set their innocent fairytales to hedonistic club beats on Eat Shiitake Mushrooms and the stunning Donnie Darko that they create something not just bewitching, but mould-breaking. Let’s Eat Grandma play Field Day festival, London, on 11 June 2016.\n",
      "Michail Antonio strikes early to give West Ham victory over Tottenham This is the kind of defeat that can leave a team questioning their title credentials. It was not that Tottenham Hotspur were thrashed or even outclassed, in the East End. There were periods during a frantic second half when they had threatened to claw back the deficit suffered early on and had they pilfered an equaliser, they would have departed buoyed as if in victory. West Ham United, after all, are a resurgent force and now a team who have the scent of the Champions League places. Yet, for all that there is no disgrace in succumbing to these opponents, Spurs’ uncharacteristic hesitancy was troubling. The pangs of anxiety had gripped through a one-sided first half, rendering their approach tentative and ineffective. Mauricio Pochettino denied it but the suspicion was that this was the first evidence of nerves undermining the club’s pursuit of a first league championship in 55 years. This team, the youngest in the Premier League, were supposed to be fearless, blissfully unaware of everything that could yet be achieved this season. And yet here they had initially been diminished in the face of their hosts’ aggression and eclipsed by their energy. Those traits were supposed to be their own. Even when they roused themselves after the interval, forcing West Ham back largely through Christian Eriksen’s tireless running and clever probing, anxiety still unnerved their approach. Harry Kane, the team’s only attacking focal point but a lone striker starved of service for long periods, summed that up by snatching at two close-range opportunities. The England forward had been unable to contort his body to convert in the six-yard box, under pressure from Cheikhou Kouyaté, after Adrián had done wonderfully well to push away Toby Alderweireld’s swerving attempt from distance. When Christain Eriksen sent over a delicious centre moments later Kane mistimed his stretch and could only dribble the attempt wide from just beyond the back post. There has been only one goal from open play in eight matches and, at some stage, there may have to be an acknowledgment that the weight of this team’s schedule – this was a ninth game in 32 days – could be having a blunting effect. Adrián in the home goal was not tested at all in the first half and only rather sporadically when Tottenham held greater sway. Certainly the post-match shuffle towards the away support to demonstrate their appreciation, and the gloom in the dressing room long after the final whistle, suggested this was an opportunity missed. The visit of Arsenal on Saturday has suddenly been transformed into a test of character. Spurs can still top the division, for a few hours at least, by winning the north London derby. Given the idiosyncratic nature of the title race – Leicester’s point on Tuesday had looked wasteful but actually represented the sole reward for any of the top four in midweek – this need not prove an arithmetically damaging loss. But, psychologically, it seems far more significant. The top flight’s stingiest defence had been bullied, with Alderweireld and Kevin Wimmer tormented by Emmanuel Emenike’s channel-running, hassling and harrying. The centre-halves were both booked and it would not have been a surprise had Wimmer been dismissed before the end. West Ham merited their success, their prolonged send-off from the Boleyn Ground having still not contained a defeat since August. This result mirrored Saturday’s success over Sunderland, a win achieved courtesy of a sole Michail Antonio goal scored relatively early, and was illuminated by flashes of brilliance from Dimitri Payet and leggy industry up and down the lineup. Their pressing disoriented the visitors, who are used to imposing their own upbeat rhythm. They forced early errors, confusion between Ben Davies and Nacer Chadli needlessly presenting the hosts with an early corner which Payet whipped in to the near post. There it was met emphatically by Antonio, the right wing-back having dizzied Chadli too easily with his movement to earn a yard of space from the befuddled winger. The ball flew in via Hugo Lloris’ left hand. It was the fourth successive home match in which the summer signing from Nottingham Forest had scored, and it should have been followed by further first-half reward. Lloris, jittery particularly from back-passes throughout on a treacherous surface, did well to push away Mark Noble’s attempt from distance but only a series of desperate blocks prevented West Ham going further ahead. “Even to match a team that has conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League, scored the most, [are] all about running and pressing and whose confidence is sky high, you have to play very well,” said Slaven Bilic. “It’s not about being lucky. You have to deserve it. I might be biased but they should have been more happy with the result than us. It could have been more. We were simply magnificent.” The same, for once, cannot be said of Spurs. They go into the north London derby with another point to prove.\n",
      "Rio has showcased a post-Brexit nationalism the left should embrace Who could resent the captain of the British women’s hockey team, Kate Richardson-Walsh, carrying the flag at the Olympic closing ceremony in Rio? Her wife Helen, who was also on the team, had played a pivotal role in their win (on receiving their golds, they became the first same-sex married couple to win Olympic medals). The entire GB team wore jackets that said “thank you” to Brazil in Portuguese and “hello” to Tokyo where the next Olympics takes place. I’m not a sports fan, but as a nation we have been pretty fantastic and it seems entirely appropriate to celebrate the achievements of these athletes and to feel, dare I say it … a little bit proud. Oh, but here come the begrudgers. We certainly could win a gold for self-loathing whinging. We only got so many medals because of the money thrown at sports through the national lottery. We must not get all puffed up and nationalistic because that is a bad thing. Sport has nothing to do with our place in the world, it merely reveals many of the existing inequalities, and on and on it goes. But surely the fact that in 1996 we came 36th in the medal table, below North Korea, and now we have pipped China, has given some much-needed uplift to a divided country? Of course, being good at physical jerks does not suddenly make post-Brexit Britain a happy place. We know that the dreamlike quality of the 2012 games, kicked off by Danny Boyle’s bonkers and brilliant opening ceremony, where everyone went mad for Mo Farah and felt the love, did not last. Anti-immigrant and out-and-proud racist discourse has absolutely flourished in the intervening years. But again in Rio we saw that winners come in all sizes, shades and sexualities and when they do brilliantly everyone gets behind them. I am not always fond of folk wrapping themselves in flags but nationalism is always an imaginary concept that can be mobilised in whichever way we choose. This nationalism – inclusive, warm, sentimental, hardworking – is the one the left should embrace, but is too often embarrassed about. So it leaves nationalism for others to remake in their own brutal image. The refusal of so many people to understand that globalisation does not work out for everyone, or that mumbling at rallies about internationalism makes few hearts sing, is precisely why so many were out of touch with the result of the EU referendum. Yes, some of it was about Little England, but some of it was about how we define ourselves as a nation. Can we go it alone? Can we punch above our weight? Is this just a post-empire hangover? The answers are complex. The nation represented at the Olympics was at ease with multiple identities – sometimes Andy Murray is Scots, sometimes British. Bradley Wiggins, Nicola Adams and Mo Farah all belong together as champions here. Telling people that nationalism is wrong and infantile seems to me to misunderstand the mood. Right now we need to ask what kind of country we want to be. As Albert Camus once said, “I should be able to love my country and still love justice”. Surely that is possible. After the ugliness in the run-up to the Brexit vote and immediately afterwards, we were reminded of the best of ourselves in Rio. That is a real victory.\n",
      "Tottenham lose title hopes and all control in draw with Chelsea Well, you can’t say they didn’t go down fighting. It took until the final half-hour for Tottenham Hotspur’s title challenge finally, definitively to unravel but from the seventh minute, when Mousa Dembélé initiated a snarling squabble with Mikel John Obi, to the seventh minute of stoppage time, when the final whistle blew and players and managers brawled on their way down the tunnel, this was a display full more of malice than of merit. In this astonishing season, now embellished with its 5,000-1 champions, how Dembélé made it all the way to stoppage time before he was booked might be the greatest miracle of all. In the dying moments of the first half, after Danny Rose slid in late on Willian in front of the Spurs dug-out, players and coaches from both sides came together in a mêlée that distracted the officials sufficiently for the Belgian to push his nails into one of Diego Costa’s eyes and down his face and emerge unnoticed and unpunished. Costa is used to winning trophies and being unpleasantly aggressive to others; here it was he who was bullied, and then he helped present a trophy to someone else. Earlier Kyle Walker had pushed Pedro to the floor and then kicked him, gently but deliberately, in the shin. And so it continued. Érik Lamela, booked early in the first half for a two-footed foul on Cesc Fàbregas, later appeared to tread on the Spaniard’s hand. Of Tottenham’s outfield players, by the end only Toby Alderweireld had not been booked and it would be a surprise if Dele Alli, retrospectively banned from this and Tottenham’s remaining two top-flight fixtures after punching a player in their previous game, did not have company on the sidelines as Spurs’ season peters out – potentially quite a lot of company. Guus Hiddink spoke afterwards about how these bad-tempered occasions “happen a lot in the Latin world”, alluding perhaps to Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham’s Argentinian manager, who twice entered the pitch to get involved in the bad-tempered action, at one stage had to be separated from Steve Holland, Chelsea’s assistant first-team coach, and was at the centre of the post-match brawl, which began when Hiddink attempted to chaperone Fàbregas past him and down the tunnel (the Dutchman, who speaks Spanish, said later that his player was being threatened in the language). Pochettino has fashioned a young and vibrant team and minutes after the game’s end spoke calmly and genially to the media, but he showed here that the spirit of Antonio Rattin, famously, furiously sent off in a World Cup quarter-final 50 years ago and eight miles away, lives within him. “It’s football,” he said. “We are men, they are men and we need to show we are strong.” The irony is that it was supposed to be Chelsea who were motivated by spite. There was little for them to play for but professional pride – which has not always been evident in their performances this season – and a refusal to cede the title they won a year ago to local rivals. It proved motivation enough, with Eden Hazard, whose assertion that “we don’t want Tottenham to win the league, if we can beat them it will be good”, represented the apotheosis of the pre-match trolling, coming off the bench wonderfully to complete their comeback from a two-goal half-time deficit. There was a moment before kick-off, as a giant “Pride of London” banner was carried across the Shed End by Chelsea’s fans, when it was tempting to wonder if they would continue passing it around the stadium until it reached the other end. Failing that, perhaps they could be tempted to stuff it into a large bag and hide it in a cupboard for the foreseeable future. There is, after all, a shelf in the club’s trophy cabinet that has just become available. But within this performance Chelsea’s players showed that perhaps they share with their fans a desire to wrest back the status they have so emphatically and humiliatingly lost this season. Of course, there were always three teams in this marriage. As Asmir Begovic prepared to take the free-kick, deep on Chelsea’s left-wing, that followed Walker’s first, early foul on Pedro, a fan in the front row immediately behind him held up a placard that read, “Let’s do it for Ranieri”. But few Chelsea supporters at that stage seemed to be thinking of Leicester, just of their club’s own superiority, temporarily misplaced. “Champions of Europe,” they bellowed repeatedly, “you’ll never see that.” It is just four years since Chelsea won the Champions League; in the build-up to this game Hiddink described his side’s remaining fixtures – against Sunderland, Liverpool and Leicester, of which only one now seems at all important in any real sense, and that only to Chelsea’s opponents – as “massive games”, an illustration of how far, how fast they have fallen. But then, in the final moments, as the game headed towards its savage and definitive conclusion, the home fans burst into the loudest song of the night: “Leicester, champions!” They are no longer the kings, but they took to the role of kingmakers rather well.\n",
      "Matt Miazga: Chelsea's pull proves too strong for Red Bulls' standout defender With Thierry Henry snarling in his direction, incredulous at the howler made by the New York Red Bulls’ rookie 18-year-old, Matt Miazga looked to have a rather steep learning curve ahead of him. The New Jersey native of Polish descent has certainly scaled that arc in the 18 months since that blunder against the Columbus Crew, but now he has another peak to climb. London is calling. Miazga this week completed a remarkable rise, with Chelsea wrapping up a £3.5m move for the centre-back. At 20, he in the vanguard of Major League Soccer’s homegrown crop, and at Stamford Bridge he will be given the kind of platform no American player has had since Tim Howard also made the move from New York to the Premier League over 12 years ago. The past year was unanimously acknowledged to have been a good one for Miazga – lifting the Supporters’ Shield as one of the Red Bulls’ standout performers – but maybe not this good. So what are Chelsea getting from their new American stopper? At 6ft 4in, the lanky Miazga certainly commands a presence, but there is a technicality to his game too. Athleticism is indeed his greatest – and most obvious – asset, yet his ability on the ball will serve him well in a more technically demanding division. Miazga can pass. He arrives with an international background too, although his track record makes Timothy Chandler look like a flag-waving nationalist. Miazga turned out for the United States’ Under-14s, -16s and -20s sides, but also played for Poland’s Under-16s and -18s. His future was the subject of discussion – Poland wanted him to commit – but his substitute appearance for USA in a World Cup qualifier against St Vincent & the Grenadines put paid to Polish hopes. It was for USA that Miazga first caught the eye of Premier League scouts. Last year’s Under-20 World Cup was a breakthrough event for the defender, with Tab Ramos’s side only knocked out on penalties by eventual winners Serbia. He might not have been Captain America, but in effect Miazga was the USA’s leader at the back, showing the kind of leadership capacity not seen in many players of his age. By his own admission, he is hardly a natural figurehead but has worked hard at that aspect of his game. In MLS terms, Miazga has pedigree, marking David Villa out of a Yankee Stadium derby in a nationally televised game last June, and also finding the net for the Red Bulls in a 3-1 win. At Chelsea, however, the 20-year-old will have to prove himself all over again. First-team opportunities will be at a premium, with some already mooting that a loan deal away from Stamford Bridge might give Miazga the best chance of making an impression in England. “We don’t rush him, but he will be one of the squad members for the future,” Guus Hiddink explained when asked about what role Miazga will play at Chelsea. “He’s a young guy stepping up to the national team and it’s always good to have such players here so you can see what they are capable of in training. He’s a young player, a promising player – let’s see if he can get himself to the high demands of this club and the Premier League.” 2015 saw the Red Bulls became a very different franchise, with billboard faces like Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill replaced by more shrewdly acquired signings. Head coach Jesse Marsch placed more of an emphasis on organic development, and Miazga was arguably the primary beneficiary of that renewed approach. He became the poster-boy for MLS’s often maligned homegrown program. “I think he’s been one of the best defenders in the league this year and should be considered in that echelon,” Marsch gushed towards the close of last season. “His starting points are very high – everything from his mentality, to his awareness, to his athleticism – which means his ceiling is very high.” Others aren’t so convinced, though. “He is a really nice guy, but pretty naive and he plays young,” a mystery former teammate, who apparently played with Miazga in New York, told the Secret Footballer. “He looks big but he is soft, so hopefully he gets a little stronger and meaner otherwise he will be eaten alive in the Premier League. He is a good kid, so I am happy for him, but he needs to be loaned out to get experience.” Miazga has resisted the Premier League’s overtures before – with Leicester City and Stoke City both reportedly interested parties – but this time English soccer’s pull has proven too strong. The defender could probably have used at least another year in MLS, backing up what he achieved last season, but the appeal of joining one of the game’s biggest clubs is understandable. On the flip side, Chelsea fans – with little over 48 hours of the transfer window remaining – will surely question how the signing of Miazga, as well as Alexandre Pato, can possibly turn around their ailing campaign. Why the latter was sought is anyone’s guess, but Miazga has been signed with at least one eye on the future. The past year has taken him further than anyone could have envisaged – providing encouragement that in a better league he will only improve further. And with Henry now working as a TV pundit in England he might still have the Frenchman to send him a well-meaning scowl every so often.\n",
      "Leicester’s gloom darkens after Romelu Lukaku seals win for Everton After this match it was hard to know which stretched credibility further: Claudio Ranieri’s claim that he did not notice the 30,000 people in the stadium wearing Jamie Vardy masks, or the fact that Leicester City are the English champions. The last time Leicester hosted Everton, in May, they were presented with the Premier League trophy; here all that was on display was a petty public relations stunt and a sad contrast between the title winners of last season and this Leicester side. Everton did not need to excel to claim their first away win since September. Everton finished looking like accomplished travellers but overall this was a low-quality contest that made for particularly painful viewing for supporters of the home side. That included Vardy, who sat in the stands as he began his three-match suspension for his red card against Stoke City. Leicester had been so aggrieved at the Football Association’s rejection of an appeal against that ban that the club arranged for masks of their striker to be handed out before kick-off. Some kind of protest? Ranieri said he knew nothing about it. That, at least, was wise. Vardy’s punishment must have felt particularly severe in view of the calibre of play he had to watch. The first 45 minutes were wretched, amounting to a late but compelling entry for the worst half of football in 2016. Everton were especially pallid initially and must have reinforced Ronald Koeman’s eagerness to bring in new blood during the January transfer window. Koeman’s side improved in the second period, however, finally summoning the wit to take advantage of the fact Leicester had been forced to deploy a weakened defence because of the bans of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs. The home team’s replacements were a veteran, the 36‑year‑old centre-back Marcin Wasilewski, and a novice, the 20-year-old Ben Chilwell. The latter performed well but the former’s lack of pace alongside Wes Morgan in central defence was exposed by Everton in the 51st minute. All it took was a long punt over the home defence by the visiting goalkeeper, Joel Robles. Kevin Mirallas set off in pursuit of it, easily outrunning the lumbering centre‑backs. Kasper Schmeichel was unable to prevent the Belgian from firing Everton into the lead. That was Everton’s first strike on goal in the match. Their only previous attempt in the general direction of the target, a feeble header by Ramiro Funes Mori after a cross by Mirallas, was so inoffensive that most statisticians are unlikely to have recorded it as a shot. Leicester had gone only a little closer, Daniel Amaratey forcing a routine save from Robles in the 10th minute with a respectable shot from 20 yards after a neat exchange with Shinji Okazaki. There was a grievous lack of creativity from both sides. Ranieri tried to change that at half-time by replacing introducing Danny Drinkwater for Okazaki. After Everton took the lead and began to grow in confidence Ranieri threw on Riyad Mahrez, too. Of his decision to omit from the starting lineup the Premier League player of the year last season, the manager later said: “He’s not in good form and I want to stimulate him. He must give more for the team.” Leicester supporters were also in the mood for telling home truths. They booed Ranieri’s third substitution, not because they had anything against the new arrival, Leonardo Ulloa, but because the man he replaced, Demarai Gray, had been Leicester’s brightest attacker. Ranieri said the switch was made for the sake of team balance. Ulloa’s header within moments of arriving was easily saved by Robles. That was the closest Leicester came to infiltrating Everton’s three-man defence. Everton controlled the game as it wore on, with Tom Davies a vibrant midfield presence after his introduction midway through the second half. Idrissa Gueye should have made certain of victory in the 82nd minute but shot over the bar from close range after a low pass across goal by Romelu Lukaku. In the 90th minute Lukaku did the job himself, racing on to another long ball forward before outmuscling Morgan, outwitting Wasilewski and finishing smartly. What began as dreary fare ended up as a highly satisfying trip for Koeman’s team.\n",
      "Leicester fans celebrate football's unlikeliest win Fairy tales really do come true after all it seems. Less than 10 months after starting the season as 5,000-1 outsiders, Leicester City is celebrating its first Premier League title after rivals Tottenham Hotspur failed to clinch the victory needed to keep their own hopes alive. As well as gifting Leicester with one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time, Tottenham’s 2-2 draw with Chelsea set off a chain reaction ranging from a multimillion-pound hammering for bookies to the prospect of Gary Lineker now having to make good on a promise to present Match of the Day in his underwear should the club where he started his sporting career win the league. In the Midlands, fans and players got down to the serious business of celebrating at venues ranging from heaving pubs to the home of talismanic striker Jamie Vardy. For the team’s players – who could have clinched the title on Sunday at Old Trafford but could only manage a 1-1 draw with Manchester United – the cauldron of Old Trafford had been swapped for hospitality at Vardy’s house. In the end, the title was delivered to Leicester courtesy of an equalising goal by Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, whose 83rd-minute strike squared the game with Spurs. As a wave of emotion surged from homes, pubs, community centres and other gatherings of fans in Leicester, the moment when the team’s players at Vardy’s house learned that they were champions was captured by defender Christian Fuchs in a video that immediately went viral. Vardy himself also didn’t disappoint those expecting a reaction on social media, posting an riposte to his Tottenham counterpart, Harry Kane, whose recently tweeted image of a pack of lions had been seen as a message designed to suggest that his side were hunting Leicester down. Without words, Vardy posted an image of the moment when one of the characters from the Lion King, Mufasa, falls to his death after struggling to gain a clawhold on a cliff face as a stampede takes place below. As car horns hooted outside his window, Leicester’s mayor, Peter Soulsby, told the : “We thought it couldn’t get any better 12 months ago when the eyes of the world were on us as we reinterred the bones of Richard III, but this is even better. “We are very proud of what is probably the most diverse city in Europe and in fact many people see the team as a metaphor because it shows what you can really achieve when you bring a diverse group of people together.” He added that the official celebrations will take place after the end of the season “although we will have two weeks of parties before then of course”. Alan Sugar, a former Spurs chairman, was among the first to send his congratulations, tweeting even before the final whistle: “Well done Leicester. Very well deserved and a demonstration that you don’t need £50m players.” There were also immediate congratulations from Downing Street, where the Twitter account of David Cameron sent out the message within seconds of the game finishing: “Many congratulations to Leicester. An extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.” On the other side of the political divide, shadow chancellor John McDonnell was drawing parallels between Leicester’s unlikely triumph and the elevation of another rank outsider: “Who would of predicted a year ago that Leicester would win the Premier League & Jeremy Corbyn would be Labour leader? Congrats to Leicester.” Lineker, no doubt turning some of his thoughts quietly to the garments he would soon have to don, described the result as the biggest shock of his lifetime, later telling the BBC: “If it means that I have to wear pants during Match of the Day then I suppose I look forward to it.” Having returned to Italy to fulfil a lunch date with his 96-year-old mother, Leicester’s manager, Claudio Ranieri, was meanwhile reported to have flown back on a private jet in time to watch the game at his flat in the Midlands. In the run-up to kick-off, pubs in Leicester had been heaving for a second night in a row with fans decked out in the club’s blue – even if some had initially appeared to be saving their pennies on a bank holiday weekend by watching the game at home before properly indulging themselves next weekend. Hazard’s equaliser changed all that though, sending thousands on to the streets of the city. At least 1,000 fans arrived at the team’s King Power stadium, where crowds chanted “Leicester ’til I die” and “Championes!” to mark the Foxes clinching the title. Richard Hamilton, 23, said: “It’s just amazing, the city has come out for this and it’s just brilliant for the fans and the city as a whole.” Other groups of fans celebrating in the city included Steve Robinson, 26, who told reporters: “This year I got married and had a baby, but this tops it all.”\n",
      "Claudio Ranieri wants Leicester City’s stars to stay for the long haul Claudio Ranieri has warned his Leicester players they could end up “carrying the bags” at another club if they are tempted to leave in the summer, with the Italian hoping to add to his squad at the end of their remarkable season regardless of whether they qualify for Europe. Leicester head into Monday night’s meeting with struggling Newcastle knowing they will still be top of the Premier League even if Tottenham defeat bottom side Aston Villa on Sunday. Ranieri’s side have been leading the race for the title for almost every week since a 3-0 victory over Newcastle at the end of November and are now nine matches away from what would be the club’s first top-flight title. It is a measure of how far his side have come that the Italian was forced to swat aside rumours linking his playmaker Riyad Mahrez with a move to the European champions, Barcelona, at his pre-match press conference. But despite the Algerian, the 19-goal Jamie Vardy and the defensive midfielder N’Golo Kanté being among those likely to be on the wishlists of several clubs in the summer transfer window, Ranieri is confident he can keep hold of them. “I think the players want to stay here. I am very confident. This is my idea,” he said. “I spoke to them some time ago. I said: ‘We are building a very good team’. I spoke with everybody. They can be a big player with us, they can improve with us. If they change team – my experience says to them: ‘Ok, you are very ambitious but remember Leicester will be in a very high position. You go to another team, I don’t know what will happen’.” Asked if he meant they would play less, Ranieri added: “I laugh and I say: ‘Hey, look, why do you go there? To bring the suitcases? Stay with me, you will play’.” Leicester were frustrated in their attempts to add to their squad in January, with moves for the Nigeria forward Ahmed Musa of CSKA Moscow and Loïc Rémy of Chelsea not coming to fruition. Yet Ranieri believes they will require a much deeper squad for next season, having used less players than any other club in the Premier League so far. “We will try to sign maybe two or three to improve because I am very, very hungry,” he said. “We lost the FA Cup, the League Cup. I want to move forward more. So we need more strength, more players. “The players who come must be better than we had if we want to build together and grow up together. Now we know very well, this season is out. Doesn’t count. This season is strange. Our target at the beginning was save the team, this year. “Next year was to build slowly the foundation, to grow up, to achieve the Europa League, the Champions League, maybe one day fight for the title. This is our programme. Next season we restart with a new mentality. For example: ‘I don’t know what happened last season’. We must continue to build our team.” Of Leicester’s current squad, only the reserves Marcin Wasilewski and Gökhan Inler have any experience of winning a domestic league title, with Anderlecht in Belgium and FC Zürich in Switzerland respectively. But Ranieri believes the rest of his players have proved they have the necessary hunger to maintain their run until the end of the season. “Now I know them much better than at the beginning and I can compare how they are working … they are getting better, getting better, getting better,” he said. “The team is the superstar, but there are no superstars. And everyone must be working. Of course, my experience can help them. Maybe they believe more. I don’t know because I don’t speak about that. “It is important for me when I tell you something and I see you are trying to do what I want – not for me, for the team.”\n",
      "Swansea earn Bob Bradley first point as manager in draw with Watford Suited and booted, Bob Bradley at least looked the part this week after opting for a wardrobe change, yet the transformation on the pitch under the new manager will have to wait after Swansea City’s winless run stretched to eight matches. There were positives for the American to take, notably the performance of Modou Barrow and the sight of Alfie Mawson playing so well on his Premier League debut, yet the harsh reality is that this was two points dropped. Without a victory since the opening day, Swansea remain in the relegation zone, second from bottom and with a tricky run of fixtures to come, starting with a trip to Stoke on Monday week. A win in Bradley’s first home game in charge would have lifted some of the gloom and it so nearly arrived during a second half when Barrow tormented Watford with his pace and trickery, Gylfi Sigurdsson hit the upright and Heurelho Gomes denied Mike Van der Hoorn from point-blank range. It was that sort of day for Swansea at the end of a very difficult week, during which the club’s supporters’ trust voiced their unhappiness that Huw Cooze, their elected director on the board, was not notified by the owners of the decision to replace Francesco Guidolin with Bradley. In the match programme, Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, who bought a majority stake in Swansea in the summer, apologised for their actions. “Not informing him sooner as to our ultimate choice was an error on our part and for which we take full responsibility,” they wrote. Bradley, in fairness, received a warm ovation from the Swansea fans before the match. He also showed that he is not afraid to ruffle a few feathers among the players when he made five chances to the team, including dropping both centre-backs, Jordi Amat and Federico Fernández. Whether Bradley can find firepower in this team, however, is another matter, with the lack of confidence in front of goal brutally exposed. “We have to trust the fact that if we work the right way, if our football gets better, if we compete better, if we do all these little things to improve, the points will come,” he said. “I’m disappointed. As we were going through the second half, there were a number of occasions where I thought: ‘Here it is.’ But when it doesn’t come, I don’t want to forget the things that for me were very positive.” Mawson’s display was among them. Signed from Barnsley in the summer, the 22-year-old acquitted himself well alongside Van der Hoorn, who had arguably the best chance of the game when he stabbed Sigurdsson’s free-kick towards goal only for Gomes to block with his legs. Sigurdsson later shot tamely into the arms of the Watford keeper and swept a 20-yard effort on to the foot of the post – both opportunities arriving following excellent work from the lively Barrow. Watford, who are ninth in the table and on a decent run of form, seemed content to play on the counterattack, especially after the interval, and threatened only sporadically. Valon Behrami was aggrieved that Paul Tierney, the referee, failed to point to the spot when he went down under a challenge from Kyle Naughton – it looked more like a tangle of legs – and the substitute Nordin Amrabat snatched at a half-chance after breaking through in the inside-left channel. As for Bradley, at least his attire was an improvement on the all-black outfit he wore at Arsenal. “I have to wait to see the reviews tomorrow,” he said, smiling. “I’m still trying to figure what out works over here.”\n",
      "Polio cases could be wiped out within 12 months, says World Health Organisation The World Health Organisation is confident polio is in its dying days and could be eradicated within 12 months, despite challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the virus is still endemic and vaccination campaigns are sometimes targeted by extremists. If the virus is wiped out, polio will become only the second human-hosted virus to be eradicated since the end of smallpox in 1980. “We absolutely need to keep the pressure up, but we think we could reach the point where we have truly interrupted the transmission at the end of the year or the end of the low season [winter] next year,” said Michel Zaffran, the WHO’s director of polio eradication. So far this year, just nine cases of wild – as opposed to vaccine-derived – polio virus have been recorded: two in Afghanistan and seven in Pakistan. Noting that there were generally fewer cases of polio in the cold winter months, Zaffran said that, even if there was a spike in recorded cases during the summer, the WHO believed it could still end transmission by early next year. “It is going to be an extraordinary achievement. This has been an ongoing effort since 1988. We started with 150 countries and we are now just down to two countries and nine cases [so far this year],” said Zaffran. Since the start of the global polio eradication initiative in 1988, transmission of the wild polio virus, which used to paralyse hundreds of thousands of children every year, has ceased in all countries apart from Afghanistan and Pakistan. There have been false dawns in this battle, such as in 2013, when the virus re-emerged in Nigeria, Syria and Iraq, where it had previously been eradicated. All three are now free from polio once again. The WHO is concentrating its efforts in three areas known to be reservoirs for the virus – the Pakistani city of Karachi and two cross-border corridors, around Quetta Block and in the Peshawar district. Zaffran said 47 districts in Afghanistan have been prioritised for vaccination and surveillance, of which 32 are under control of anti-government forces. “In these cases it is difficult to reach the children. We are vaccinating at transit points but we are still confident, because we’ve only had two reported cases this year so far compared to 22 [total cases] last year. We know when polio strikes because when a child is paralysed, the parents seek help and when they cannot find it locally they move,” said Zaffran. In Karachi, the WHO is intensifying its efforts to reach pockets of children missed during previous vaccination drives. “If we can achieve this, it is enormous: not only will it be the second human pathogen to be eradicated ever but it will be a great legacy for the world in terms of efficacy of vaccination programmes,” said Joël Calmet, a doctor with Sanofi Pasteur, a polio vaccine manufacturer. Calmet said the end of polio will be a “landmark for humankind” because it has created a public health model for vaccination even in the most difficult and challenging places. “The original deadline for eradication was 2000, which was said to be too challenging at the time, but now I think they set the barrier too high to mobilise everyone to collectively step up as there were too many cases and not enough was happening to reduce them,” he said. “A 20-year delay might seem enormous, but polio has been around for thousands of years and to have got rid [of it] will be amazing.”\n",
      "Swansea City 1-1 Manchester City: Premier League final day – as it happened Ah yes, the transfer season European Championship is upon us! Yes! So, we’ll see you for that, and in the meantime, thanks all for your comments and company. Bye! So, that’s that for another season, and, despite a squid of a final day, what a season it’s been. Leicester champions, Sunderland relegating Newcastle, Chelsea imploding, Arsenal and Spurs collapsing, West Ham progressing, two promoted teams staying up - and all the rest. However will we fill our days until August? And that’s that for Manuel Pellegrini. City take the fourth Champions League spot - unless United beat Bournemouth by 19 clear goals. Swansea finish a deeply creditable eleventh. We all wonder quite what the Old Trafford abandonment will mean. 90+3 min “I’m no great lover of Navas, he’s consistently been an odd weak point in this team,” emails Matt Dony. “But I’d kind of like to see what Klopp could do with him. I’d be quite happy to see a sly Liverpool bid for him.” I don’t know - maybe he’d coach him better, but it seems too late to have him play with his head up. 90+2 min Aguero won’t win the golden boot this season - he departs to be replaced by Toure, making perhaps his last appearance for City. And what a player he has been for them, if not the best in their history certainly the best in big games. 90 min There will be three added minutes. 90 min Swansea look to go forward at the same as they look to knock the ball along the back-four. They’ve barely threatened this half. 88 min Crivens, Spurs are 5-1 down at Relegatednewcastle; it was 2-1 when Mitrovic was sent-off. This is an absolutely world-class paddy from them. 86 min This game is phutting and sputtering to a finish. 85 min Sky News are reporting that a controlled explosion has taken place at Old Trafford. And dearie me, what a state of affairs: people can’t just go to a football match for fear other people might blow them up. I fear this isn’t the end of that story. 84 min Around the grounds: Leicester and Chelsea are drawing 1-1-, Olivier Giroud has scored a hat-trick for Arsenal against Villa, and Newcastle, down to ten men, lead champions-elect, best team, best football in the league players Spurs, 3-1. 82 min Sagna goes down with no one near him, rarely a good sign. While he receives treatment, Gomis replaces Montero. 81 min While Jesus Navas gives City balance of a sort - pace on the wing, a natural right-side who looks to go on the outside - you’d think not playing well much might restrict his appearances. 80 min Leroy Fer tries a stepover, and is robbed by Clichy. It’s bit like this. 78 min Brilliant from City. De Bruyne breaks through the centre with the ball and finds Aguero, who moves across the face of the box from right-to-left before swivelling into a reverse-pass for Nasri. His low cross is a dangerous one, but eludes all those in the middle and Kingsley wallops clear. 75 min He may be a kind of Silva-lite, but I’m surprised Nasri hasn’t played more recently; he’s composed on the ball, a goal threat, and a bit nasty, none of them qualities with which City are replete. 74 min Ayew finds Barrow on the right, but he can’t find a way past Clichy, and City break; Britton slides in and lifts a leg to halt De Bruyne, for which he is booked. 73 min Nasri has taken up a position on the left, with De Bruyne moving in behind Aguero. 73 min Nasri replaces Iheanacho. 71 min Bony warms up and is cheered by the home crowd. It was put to me recently that he’s bulked up and lost whatever pace he had and that looks a fair explanation; he used to be quite good. 70 min Hart, Silva, Aguero, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Iheanacho: the only City players safe when Guardiola arrives, I’d say. 68 min Montero runs at Sagna, played into trouble by Navas, and forces the foul. It earns him a yellow card, and Swansea a free-kick, close the by-line and box, but the cross is too high and ill directed. 67 min This Navas-Fernando situation highlights the dangers of scouting according to job description, rather than quality. City needed players in their positions, but neither is good enough to be a first-teamer. 66 min Lovely play down the left between Navas and Fernando, a one-two allowing the former to cross, low. Naturally, he hits the first man. 64 min Back to United, you wonder if they’ll be watching this game wondering if they might, somehow, have avoided conceding two goals in eight minutes after taking the lead at West Ham. 62 min Aguero lifts a lovely scooped ball into the box and follows it like a ferret, unwinding for a shot - but Amat does just enough, sliding in and forcing him to slice wide. 60 min Lovely ball from Clichy, slotted behind Rangel for Iheanacho, taking up another dangerous position. Without looking, he squares gently for Aguero, but Rangel recovers well to concede a corner - it comes to nothing. 60 min Stoke have equalised against West Ham, Imbula with the goal. 58 min Change for Swansea: Barrow replaces Routledge. 58 min And Fernandez’s corner is a good one, picking out Fernandez 10 yards out at the back post. He heads it back from whence it came, but the ball loops wide. 57 min And there he goes, roadrunning at his man and winning a corner... 55 min Swansea have barely been able to get Montero on the ball so far - they might look to address that in the next bit. 54 min This game is getting stretched - 1-1 will not be the final score. 52 min Huge let-off for Swansea and Nordfeldt! Iheanacho, more or less dead centre, slipped right to Aguero, who advanced and rolled in Navas. His low cross was straight at the keeper, but he somehow directed it into Iheanacho’s path - the goal was gaping, only for him to trip over the ball readjusting his feet. 51 min Swansea make space down the left and Kingsley nashes into it, absolutely slamming his cross aeons and hectares past the backpost. 48 min I wonder how many of this back four Guardiola will keep when he arrives at Eastlands. I suppose Kompany is safe as captain and totem - though I’m not sure he’ll be a regular, given his injury record. But Otamendi and Mangala are not exactly what Guardiola’s type. 46 min City immediately win a corner down the left, De Bruyne’s kick headed clear by Fernandez. But the loose ball finds its way back to him, now at the corner of the box, and he whips a brilliant cross towards the far post, where Mangala heads over the top. Great chance. 46 min And off we go again... Sky reckon that at some point, there’ll be a controlled explosion at Old Trafford. “What’s the protocol for an abandoned game? Do you bother replaying it if it doesn’t change anything?” asks St Fual on Twitter. I’m pretty sure they’d replay it whatever, but with money on offer for where teams finish, plus potential Europa League issues, this one doesn’t fall into that category. Well, that was a rather unexpected ending to the half. Swansea have actually played some okay stuff in safe spaces, unable to muster any kind of threat save the disallowed goal. City, on the other hand, looked dangerous throughout thanks to De Bruyne’s invention, Aguero’s hold-up play and Iheanacho’s movement. I’ve no idea what’ll happen in the second half, but both managers have work to do. Fer runs over the ball in peculiar style, fooling everyone, and Ayew then steps up looking to bend over the wall and into the top right corner. But Fernandinho waves a head in its road, sending it careering into the top left and leaving Hart flummoxed. Game on, cat pigeoned, and all that. 45 min And there’s Otamendi’s yellow card - Mangala sent a tricky ball into Iheanacho, he bumped it back, and Britton seized upon it, weaving some space and coaxing the foul. Free-kick, 25 yards out, just right of centre... 44 min After landing awkwardly challenging for a header, Iheanacho is limping - looks like one he can run off, but. 43 min Mike Dean allows Swansea an advantage and Montero cuts in, losing Sagna, but then scuffs a low swipe past the near post. 41 min More aesthetic interplay from Swansea and as Otamendi hurtles into a two-footed challenge on Rangel, Iheanacho trips him from behind - probably accidentally. He’s booked, and here comes the free-kick, 25 yards out, right of centre; Cork drifts it gently over the wall and into Hart’s hands, one bounce. 40 min Thanks to Tim O’Brien for pointing out that, thanks to Jordon Ibe’s equaliser, Liverpool are no longer losing. However, Newcastle now lead Spurs 2-0. 37 min Fantastic play from De Bruyne, finding himself on the right touchline and unfurling a majestic crossfield pass for Navas as City break. He then absolutely bousts towards the box and is there waiting for a return just as Navas wallops a useless shot over the top. 36 min Ayew pulls wide to the left by-line and digs out a cross that’s deflected behind by Mangala - the corner is a funny, midriffy height, and headed back towards the taker by Fernandez, who was held by Mangala. How Mike Dean would’ve loved gesticulating a penalty, but he either denies himself or failed to spot the offence. 36 min I should also mention that Liverpool are losing at West Brom and West Ham are winning at Stoke. 34 min Little flurry of Swansea, Ayew weaving into space 25 yards out, right of centre, and absolutely pounding a shot into Otamendi’s excellent block. And they then won the ball back, Angel floating a cross towards the back post that Montero won but could only squirt square. 33 min More on that Urawa abandonment from Patrick O’Brien, who reminds me that lightening hit the ground, and also mentions that the previous time it had happened at Old Trafford was at home to Villa in 1991. 31 min “Okay I know the situations are different but look at Liverpool’s starting 11,” emails Mike McKenzie. “Bogdan, Flanagan, Skrtel, Lucas, Smith, Stewart, Allen, Brannagan, Ibe, Ojo, Benteke. So 5 junior players start with 3 (Randall, Canos, Chirivella) on bench. And it isn’t the first time Klopp has given young guys a match. It can only be beneficial both for the players and for Klopp to evaluate them. Didn’t Fergie always say that you have to see what the kids can do?” As you say, it’s different - Klopp is resting players for the Uefa Cup Final, United were chasing 4th place. And, though there are infinite reasons to criticise Van Gaal, giving kids a chance isn’t one of them; that’s the reason United have a small squad. 29 min Montero passes back from halfway, stuck out on the touchline, and it’s nowhere near hard enough - Iheanacho is right onto it. But after transferring it into his stride, he can’t quite zone in towards goal as intended, losing his direct run at it. Even then, though, he might slip a reverse-ball into Aguero but instead lamps one over the bar. 27 min Excellent save from Nordfeldt, making his first Premier League start. Iheanacho, at inside-left, flicks outside him for Fernandinho, who crosses low to the near post. Aguero darts towards the goal then towards the ball, losing Amat and turning a low shot that’s well saved via leg extension. 24 min Ayew, Britton and Routledge do very well moving the ball from centre to right, but again, they can’t get it into a dangerous area - they’ve yet to register a shot on target. City then break and Iheanacho again takes up a dangerous position, but the ball to him is overhit and he can’t quite regain control. 22 min Iheanacho slams one over the bar from 20 yards as we learn that Spurs are losing at Newcastle. With Arsenal winning at home to Villa, of the scores stay the same, they’d finish above their rivals, having their greatest season in a generation, yet again. 20 min Swansea look sharp, as you’d expect from a team in such smart form, but hard to see them restricting De Bruyne, Aguero and Iheanacho to no more goals. 19 min More news on that United-Bournemouth abandonment, here. 17 min The last time a game as Old Trafford was abandoned - I think - was the pre-season friendly against Urawa Red Diamonds in 2004. That time, the cause a storm; it must’ve been bad to be worse than this one against Boro in 1997. 15 min Routledge causes mither down the left, moving inside to slot a ball through for Montero - but he’s wandered offside. On which point, Routledge has come on a lot the last couple of seasons. Players sometimes need patience. 13 min Surely this is it now - surely City, despite it all, can’t make a mess from here? 10 min Swansea have the ball in the net - Rangel’s swinging cross bounces in front of Sagna and Montero and the former can’t decide whether to head or kick so falls over instead, leaving the latter to bundle home. But Mike Dean mikedeans a signal that there was a push, and Niall Quinn agrees; they’re both probably right, but it’s not entirely easy to be certain. Gosh. A long, searching ball into the left corner is well held up by Aguero and then laid back for De Bruyne. His low shot was shoved away by Nordfeldt and tapped in by Iheanacho - what a knack he has. The confusion was whether or not he was offside. It looked to me as though he was, Niall Quinn was certain to the contrary, we are, of course, both neutral, so we’ll have to wait for another replay. ... 5 min On which point, my guess would be that this delay does not suit United - they need to up the pressure on City, which means scoring goals and such. 4 min 3 min City ease forward with Iheanacho, Aguero and De Bruyne, the latter arcing a venomous low cross that narrowl eludes the former, Nordfeldt snatching on the dive. Good start to the game. 2 min Lovely from Swansea, playing like a side in form and moving the ball rapidly from centre to right. Rangel, marauding down the flank, then chipped a cross that went behind off Fernandinho’s arm; no penalty, and the corner is wasted. 1 min Apparently the “Premier League works hard to synchronize everything” - by telling teams to all kick-off at the same time on the same day. Today’s game will be United’s third late kick-off in recent weeks after they got stuck in traffic en route to Spurs and were waylaid at West Ham - you may have heard. Out come the players at the Liberty. Apparently, supporters outside the Stretford End have been asked to move away from the ground. 45 minutes sounds unlikely to me, on which point Swansea-City will kick-off at 3pm. Swear down Manuel Pellegrini just said City have had a good season. Nice guy and all, but, well, y’know. Meanwhile … Turns out that, amazingly, Rojo wasn’t dropped for consistent abjectivity but, amazingly, is injured again; Schneiderlin is ill. “For Utd, I’d keep all of the first XI,” emails Laim Searle. “But the subs are the problem. Would keep Pereira, Jones and Varela, ditch the rest.” Heh - I disagree, to the extent I even know - anyone even knows - what the first XI is. The, er, “strength” in depth isn’t too bad, there just isn’t enough quality among the better players. The North Stand and Scoreboard End are still populated - more news regarding what’s going on as I get it, but on a footballing note, this could make things better or worse: Swansea-City will presumably start on time, so we’ll know whether the Battle for Fourth PlaceTM is either on or off. There’s an incident somewhere in the ground that the authorities are dealing with. The ground is emptying, and it looks like a minimum delay of 45 minutes. Let’s hope everything and everyone is ok. Let’s play a parlour game: of the City and United squads, who would you bin and who would you keep? “Is anyone taking bets on United finishing 4th, winning the FA Cup and still sacking Van Gaal?” emails Thabo Mokaleng. “I’d put down a fiver.” I’d say the first is the least likely of those... Graeme Souness reckons if United finish top four and win the Cup, Van Gaal should keep his job. Tangentially, here is some information on his time at United: BREAKING NEWS: Michael Carrick’s kids are United’s mascots today. Read into that whatever you please. Anyway, what of Bournemouth and Swansea? That’s a rhetorical question. Both have been superb this season, the former all the way through, the latter when they really needed to be The question for both is how they progress from here... Nostalgia corner: 25 years ago today, United beat Barcelona in Rotterdam to win the Cup Winners’ Cup, and English teams were back to dominate Europe. Here’s Elton Welsby and Denis Law, perhaps the only man able to wear overcoat over shoulders and still look smart as. And here’s ITV’s post-match coverage, along with some news reports. As for United, Marcos Rojo is left out following the longest jetlag on record - Cameron Borthwick-Jackson comes in. Also dropped are Ander Herrera and Morgan Schneiderlin, who, along with Rojo, isn’t even on the bench. All three were signed by Van Gaal and thought to be quite good at the time. Bournemouth make five changes: out go Boruc, Stanislas, Gradel, Afobe and Grabban; in come Federici, Surman, Pugh, Wilson and King. What does it all mean? Well, Swansea bring in Nordfeldt, Rangel, Britton and Montero for Fabianski, Naughton, Barrow and Ki; Ki is on military duty and was outstanding in their win at West Ham. City, on the other hand, are playing so well as to be unchanged. Which also means that Yaya Toure, who may well never play for City again, is on the bench. Swansea City: Nordfeldt, Rangel, Fernandez, Amat, Kingsley, Britton, Cork, Fer, Routledge, Montero, Ayew. Subs: Vickers, Naughton, Fulton, Gorre, Barrow, Emnes. Gomis. Manchester City: Hart, Sagna, Otamendi, Mangala, Clichy, Fernando, Fernandinho, Navas, De Bruyne, Iheanacho, Aguero. Caballero, Sterling, Kolarov, Demichelis, Nasri, Toure, Bony. **** Manchester United: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blind, Borthwick-Jackson; Carrick, Rooney, Lingard; Mata, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Romero, Jones, Varela, Young, Herrera, Pereira, Memphis. Bournemouth: Federici, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, Surman, Pugh, Wilson, King. Subs: Holmes, O’Kane, Gosling, Iturbe, Gradel, Grabban, Afobe. It’s been a funny old season. Well, provided your team doesn’t play in Manchester, where mirth has been conspicuous by its schadenfreude. Because, let’s be clear: City and United have both been absolutely appalling. Yes, they sit 4th and 5th in the table, but standards are relative and neither are anywhere near those demanded of them. Naturally, they have accomplished this in different ways: where City are a debacle, United are a travesty. The Blues started well then fell apart, generally defending badly and mainly struggling to score against the better teams, entirely devoid of purpose or plan; the Reds started tediously and continued similarly, occasionally defending badly and routinely struggling to score against everyone, entirely devoid of conviction or élan. So, to today. If City beat or draw with Swansea, they take the final Champions League qualifying spot; if City lose at Swansea and United beat Bournemouth, United usurp them. Which, on the face of it, it barely matters. Neither deserve to be anywhere near the competition, neither is any sort of threat to those who might win it, and neither is likely to be next season. Or, put another way, the only fitting outcome this afternoon is for City to lose and United to draw, which probably means City will score early, get the job done comfortably, and that’ll be an end to it . But, just look at the state of them! Kick-off - or kicks-off - 3pm BST\n",
      "Antonio Conte’s adaptability is helping his Chelsea side to prosper At first, the idea was simply to stop the bleeding. Three-nil down at half-time against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium a little over five weeks ago, Antonio Conte switched to a back three. The Chelsea manager had enjoyed success with the approach in his previous jobs with Juventus and the Italy team and, against Arsenal, it restored a measure of stability. Chelsea still lost, 3-0, but Conte could feel the stirrings of something. Look at Chelsea now. This was their fourth Premier League game since Conte’s tactical move and it was also their fourth clean sheet. Even better from a Chelsea perspective, Southampton never looked like scoring. The only time Thibaut Courtois was worked in the Chelsea goal was in the 28th minute, from a Dusan Tadic free-kick, and the save was entirely regulation. Claude Puel’s Southampton had entered on the back of a five-match unbeaten league run, a sequence that took in the impressive 1-1 draw at Manchester City the previous weekend. The manager deserved the plaudits that had tracked him for his dynamic style of football, in which the player in possession is encouraged to take the daring option. Puel does not tolerate sideways tedium. He has given the club’s latest reworked team the platform to play. Here it was dismantled, and Conte could revel in how he brought that about. His system has flexibility, speed and options, and it has also had Chelsea’s recent opponents gasping for breath. Southampton could not find the spaces, they had the life steadily squeezed out of them and, from the moment that Eden Hazard put Chelsea in front early on, it was possible to feel that it would be a long afternoon for the hosts. It was Chelsea who constructed the platform to play. They had 45% of possession but they made it count. It was they who created the chances and they could conceivably have scored more to emulate the 4-0 scoreline that they inflicted upon Manchester United at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. What makes Conte’s work so praiseworthy is how he has adapted. He did not moan when the summer transfer window closed and he had not made the signings he wanted; instead, Conte took what was available and worked with what he already had. David Luiz, who arrived on deadline day, looked assured again in the middle of the back three – in other words, not as though he was about to step on a rake and be smacked in the face – while César Azpilicueta, the right‑back turned left-back turned right central defender, continued to impress with his decision‑making. He did not put a foot wrong. What about Victor Moses? There have been times in the past when his Chelsea future has looked bleak. After a few months under Conte, he seems as if he has been a marauding right wing‑back all of his career. The manager described him as a pleasant “surprise”. The drive and stamina of Moses and Marcos Alonso, the left wing-back, helped to make Chelsea tick here. On Saturday, three of the major title contenders had made statements – City, Arsenal and Liverpool each scoring four times in victory – and Chelsea had to respond. How they did so, and it was the control with which they won that resonated most loudly. Conte danced around the questions about his club’s title-winning prospects but, on this evidence, the notion is far from outlandish. Conte had moved Azpilicueta back into the back three at John Terry’s expense, after the 2-1 EFL Cup defeat at West Ham United last Wednesday, with Moses and Alonso returning to the starting lineup. The A-team had been reinstated and, with N’Golo Kanté and Nemanja Matic harrying relentlessly in front of the defence, there was a robustness about Chelsea. There were numerous moments when their height and physical power was decisive, particularly in the air on defensive set-pieces and, with Haz-ard and Diego Costa at the other end, Conte had the ruthlessness where it mattered the most. Puel gave Hazard his professional debut at Lille and he could curse Steven Davis for taking his eyes off him in the sixth minute. Hazard’s goal was marked by his presence of mind. He could have crossed when Moses ushered him in but the he believed that there was a better option. For long spells Chelsea were happy to allow Southampton to have the ball, and Conte’s formation was more 5-4-1 than 3-4-3, with the wing-backs and wide attackers dropped back. When Southampton looked forward, it felt like a daunting assignment to plot the way through. Costa’s goal was a beauty out of very little and, in many respects, this was the perfectly balanced away-day performance. It ought not to have been this straightforward. Chelsea have their tails up.\n",
      "Andy Carroll and Mark Noble fire West Ham to victory against Watford This was no surprise result given the circumstances but a first win in eight for West Ham United and one in which Andy Carroll fired his calling card in the direction of Roy Hodgson once more. Carroll set West Ham on the way to a comfortable victory against a depleted Watford and was his usual swashbuckling self throughout, just weeks before England name their squad for the European Championship. The striker scored his sixth goal in five Premier League appearances and, backed up by Dimitri Payet and Diafra Sakho, was at his troublesome best against this makeshift Watford side who rested players in preparation for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Sunday. The opposition may not have been the strongest, but on this evidence Carroll is a man in as good nick as he has ever been. Payet was also excellent and Mark Noble accomplished in midfield. It was the West Ham captain who scored twice from the penalty spot before Sebastian Prödl pulled one back for Watford with a fine finish, Troy Deeney missed a late penalty and Nordin Amrabat was sent off. Yet despite their penalty miss, Watford were never in this game and their manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, insisted afterwards that he was not concerned about reports that his position is under threat even though he has steered the club to safety in their first season back in the top flight. For Slaven Bilic, there was satisfaction. A first win since early March and, following the recent Cup defeat against Manchester United and late draw at Leicester, a smile. “We said before that every game is important at this stage of the season but this was a decisive game that will determine if we look up, or if we don’t win look down,” he said. “Of course Liverpool are in good form but it’s nice to have five-point cushion [over Southampton in eighth].” Asked if the pressure was on the teams above West Ham, who will attempt to make a late push for a top-four finish, Bilic said: “The pressure is on us as well, it’s great pressure and positive pressure. It’s not like the pressure that Sunderland, Newcastle and Norwich have. It’s the pressure you are grateful for, worship for, go to church and pray it’s going to be the same for the next six years.” It did not take long for West Ham to exert control here. Watford made seven changes following the weekend victory against West Bromwich Albion – a first Premier League win in seven attempts – ahead of their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley on Sunday. However, they were undone within 11 minutes. Payet, who has been in sublime form all season following his move from Marseille last summer, cut inside and lifted a precise ball over the defence for Carroll, who prodded home with his left foot past Heurelho Gomes. West Ham’s second came controversially as José Holebas grappled with Cheikhou Kouyaté and the referee, Mike Dean, awarded a penalty. Noble sent Gomes the wrong way from the spot. Bilic’s men did not have to wait long for another, following a few minutes to forget for Almen Abdi. Watford should have pulled one back through their Swiss midfielder and moments later he gave away a blatant penalty after lunging at the West Ham right-back Michail Antonio, who had made a bustling run forward. Again Noble stepped up and again he scored, down the middle. Watford’s fans had something to cheer. in the 64th minute when the centre-half Prödl timed his run well from Steven Berghuis’s free-kick and finished sweetly with a left-footed half-volley. It was a dramatic last few minutes as Deeney, brought on at the death, had a penalty saved by Adrián after Prödl was adjudged to have been fouled by Angelo Ogbonna, before Amrabat was sent off following a second yellow card. Asked about his job security, Flores said: “I am happy. I feel good. I think it is an amazing time we have now, four matches to finish and we have 41 points, it’s amazing. We are in a position that is very comfortable. We are in the semi-final of the FA Cup, but my future does not depend on one thing. We will see what happens.”\n",

      "Amy Adams to return for Enchanted sequel Disenchanted, a belated sequel to Disney’s 2007 hit, Enchanted, is set to start shooting next summer. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Hairspray director Adam Shankman is in talks to direct the follow-up, which featured Amy Adams as an animated princess accidentally transported to contemporary Manhattan. James Marsden co-starred as her prince charming, who follows her down the wormhole, while Patrick Dempsey played a New Yorker who falls for Adams despite being engaged to Idina Menzel. Susan Sarandon was an evil queen. A sequel to the film, which took more than $340m worldwide, has been in development since 2010. This iteration of the script is said to focus of Adam’s character questioning her happily-ever-after life and accidentally triggering events that upend everyone’s lives. Adams is shortly to be seen in Tom Ford’s mordant thriller, Nocturnal Animals, and in Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi about aliens on earth, Arrival.\n",
      "Scrutiny grows on Manchester United’s José Mourinho as losses mount up It fell to Marouane Fellaini to break the news. Put up in front of the media following his team’s defeat by Watford, the midfielder told French TV: “We can say it’s a little crisis because a club like Manchester United cannot lose three games.” And there it was, the c-word. The Belgian might be overstating matters. As far as the league is concerned, the crisis-hit United are only a point behind Liverpool, who everybody agrees have started the season like a train. What’s more, a club very much like United lost four games in a row in December last year and three in a row in January 2013. So maybe Fellaini’s remarks ought to be paraphrased: a club like Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United should not lose three games when the team are managed by José Mourinho. This is the first time Mourinho has lost three consecutive games in a season since he was fresh in the door at Porto in 2002. And two of those defeats came in the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid. It is also the worst league start in the Portuguese’s all-conquering career since he first made his bow as manager, at União de Leiria in 2001, and even then his first five matches served up only a solitary defeat. The Special One has earned a reputation in this country, among many other things, as being a manager who hits the ground running, inspiring immediate faith and fire in his teams. This legend was forged in his first stint at Chelsea, where he won four of his first five games in the 2004-05 season, starting with a 1-0 win against Ferguson’s United. It set a tone that took Chelsea to their first title in 50 years. Looking back on Mourinho’s past achievements and the almost endless commentary he provided on them is interesting because the tropes that define his success have always been clearly articulated. After defeating United in August 2004 he happily admitted that his side had played with a defensive mentality, even though they were at home. “If you have to play a little bit different to win a game then you have to do it,” he said. In further remarks he stressed the team’s unity and concentration, comparing it favourably with his rivals with “great teams [who] have worked with their managers for a long time”. Just as visible in the rearview mirror are Mourinho’s flaws, however, particularly his penchant for personal attacks. It was Luke Shaw’s turn to feel the wrath of his manager at the weekend; the full-back, only recently returned from long-term injury, was accused of lacking the necessary “tactical and mental” strength to compete. In August 2004 it was United’s Mikaël Silvestre who got it in the neck. The United defender had suggested Chelsea might struggle to gel immediately under their new manager. Mourinho made sure to issue a response. “When Silvestre said we haven’t got the time to create a big team spirit he was wrong,” he said. On arrival in Italy as manager of Internazionale in 2008, Mourinho won three of his first five matches. He lost the fifth, which happened to be the derby against Milan. This time it was the opponents who had played defensively, but Mourinho was less understanding. “It’s better to lose a game than to be afraid of playing football,” he said. “Milan have a lot of experience and they know how to control the tempo, commit a tactical foul or pretend to have an injury to slow down the pace.” Kaká was singled out, having in Mourinho’s eyes feigned being fouled. The Brazilian rejected the accusation: “Mourinho makes me laugh. He’s funny.” Mourinho had the last laugh, though, as Inter won the league. After winning the Champions League with Inter, Mourinho made his move to Real where he had the best start of his career. Madrid went unbeaten in all competitions until the end of November, but that defeat was a calamity, the 5-0 manita whitewash by Barcelona that remains the worst defeat in his career. The performance was so bad, he could not even single anyone out. “I leave disappointed both in my team and my players, individually,” he said. When Mourinho returned to Chelsea as “the Happy One” in 2013, he seemed content to pursue Roman Abramovich’s ambitions of expansive, attacking football. That changed with his first defeat, in his fourth match, 1-0 at Everton. Mourinho’s verdict: “Artistic football is no use without goals.” He went on to blame André Schürrle for missing “three big chances”, before adding, in the same breath: “I don’t like to be critical of players who missed some chances.” Chelsea went on to win the league the following year, but yet the abiding memory of Mourinho’s second stint at the club will be the awful defence of their title and his graceless part in it. Now, before the leaves have even begun to turn, he is under pressure again at Old Trafford. Mourinho has taken jobs at big clubs that have fallen from grace, those that have needed an overhaul and those with the very highest of expectations. It might be the first time, however, that he has taken a job combining all three. The scrutiny is hardly about to diminish.\n",
      "Unearthly wails, Chvrches cheese and a fleeting Ghostface Killah haunt SXSW Anyone playing on the Radio Day Stage of the Austin Conference Centre deserves a medal for bravery – it’s hard to imagine a more soulless venue for a concert. It’s even more impressive when someone has the intensity to make you forget about the 70s lecture theatre-style ambience. Buckinghamshire native Jack Garratt pulled off exactly this feat on Friday lunchtime. Face screwed up, attacking a drum machine with one hand and playing a keyboard with another, he unleashed some unearthly soulful whimpers and wails during The Love You’re Given. He’s not a million miles from the Jacko-esque vocal stylings of the Weeknd, but is coming at R&B from an entirely different angle – as he proved when he straps on a guitar and plays a riff that could strip the formica off the venue’s buffet tables. This is Worry, originally released in 2014, which manages to be darkly compelling but still have a radio-friendly hook. It’s no surprise that he’s won the BBC Sound of 2016 poll and Critic’s Choice at the Brits, but to his credit there is no element of coffee-table smugness in his performance. Chvrches take the opposite presentation tack. Lined up behind a table with their computers and keyboards at chest height, they look as though they’re about to conduct a science experiment. Or, as singer Lauren Mayberry said while adjusting her synthesizer: “I feel like a bad children’s presenter from the 80s – but not that kind of a bad one.” The audience whoops, encouraging a slightly grating between-song chat – the anecdote, including one about “feeling like Jon Bon Jovi” when she asked for cheese at a gig, and fans showed her pictures of cheese on their phones – almost went on longer than the music. When the tunes arrive they’re stripped of the enjoyable bombast that fills the recorded versions, but they still strike home thanks to Mayberry’s piercing voice and the skyscraper-sized melodies. Never Ending Circles has a chorus that is 100% proof, while Leave a Trace is sleekly soulful. Despite stagecraft that amounts to little more than a few frowns and shuffles from the other two members, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty, it’s a confident triumph. Stormzy has been one of the busiest musicians at SXSW. He’s done the rounds at showcases and even attended a boat cruise, but Fader Fort was a chance to preach to the convertible. Along with acts such as Elf Kid, Little Simz, Lorne Carter and Rejjie Snow (Section Boyz were suppose to play but cancelled), he’s been responsible for showing America what grime and UK/Irish hip-hop is all about. A small crowd gathered, with a sizable South London contingent in the front, to hear Stormzy riff on the importance of post codes, MCs’ Twitter faux pas and putting doubters in their place. For someone who is a bonafide known name in the UK, Stormzy had to go through the motions of introducing himself after every track. He did so with humility and an understanding that more than 10 years after Boy In Da Corner, grime is still mostly an unknown quantity for US hip-hop fans. Some things do translate though, and when he played his biggest hit to date, Shut Up, there were head nods of recognition and a mass singalong. That energy grew when he finished with Where Do You Know Me From? – which saw actual pogoing. There was a full on circle pit at Deftones, who played the Spin showcase at Stubb’s BBQ. The nu-metal survivors drew a crowd that could hardly fit in the venue and ran through a decent amount of their 2000 album, White Pony, with Feiticeira, Knife Prty and Change (In The House Of Flies) all sending fans whirling. Chino Moreno’s voice has lost none of it’s otherworldly squeal, and when Stephen Carpenter started the main riff of My Own Summer (Shove It), Moreno let off a high pitched sound that set the circle pit off all over again. The Ninja Tune showcase was a mixed bag with early performers such as Taylor McFerrin, Leon Vynehall and Machinedrum showing the full breadth of the label’s (and its imprints such as Brainfeeder) sound. McFerrin blended jazz with down-tempo electronica that was at times plodding; Vynehall mixed up his productions with a DJ set that led into Machinedrum’s showcase, a mix of new productions which reached gabber levels of ear-drum punishment. That cleansed the palette before Ghostface Killah entered stage left – or did he? At first he sent on a young group whose name couldn’t be made out through the over saturated PA system. Once they finished a couple of a songs, to a crowd that was generous considering they weren’t on the bill – and considering they sounded like a Whitehouse track played backwards – Ghostface’s DJ came on. He proceeded to complain about the monitors for five minutes, before winning the crowd back with a whistle-stop tour through some of hip-hop’s milestones: the likes of Dead Prez, Luniz, Biz Markie and Beastie Boys. The air was sucked out of the room, though, when Ghostface Killah finally appeared and was barely audible. His middle section picked up once the sound issues were resolved, and Cappadonna joined him on stage for renditions of Tearz, Da Mystery of Chessboxin’, Ice Cream and CREAM, but they were fleeting moments in a performance that lacked the class everyone knows he can produce. It was left to Moodymann to finish the night off. After some technical difficulties of his own, during which he joined fans at the front to give away CDs and signed T-shirts, he delivered. In an apparent nod to those who came before him, he played ODB’s Got Your Money and Junie Morrison’s Suzie Thundertussy, which is itself sampled on Kanye West’s No More Parties In LA, which also samples Ghostface Killah. Wearing what looked like a beekeeper’s hat and veil, he then stepped things up, rattling off 2012’s Ibiza standout Around, by Noir & Haze, and DJ Nature’s Let It Ring. Never boring, always eclectic it showed why a show must go on attitude is vital to SXSW.\n",
      "What’s best for savers who’ve lost £160bn of interest in seven years? Not many experts thought that the “emergency” base rate cut to 0.5% on March 5, 2009 would last for long. But seven years later savers have lost around £160bn in interest, while the prospect of rate rises are slipping further into the distance. In the immediate aftermath of the cut to 0.5%, rates for savers remained relatively high. Our analysis shows how cash Isas were offering 3%, and notice accounts 3.5%, in March 2009, and for the next couple of years they hovered around this level. After all, most banks and building societies were desperate for deposits after the great financial crash, so they were willing to pay far above the Bank of England base rate. The real villain turns out to be the Funding for Lending government programme introduced in July 2012, which effectively provided cheap money for cash-strapped lenders. The effect was almost instantaneous: banks no longer needed to attract cash from savers, so they cut the rates on offer. Susan Hannums of Savingschampion.co.uk says: “While the base rate hitting the record 0.5% was bad enough, it was Funding for Lending that had one of the biggest impacts. Almost overnight, best-buy rates for savers dropped like a stone, followed by an unprecedented number of reductions on existing rates. “Today we’ve hit over 4,000 rate reductions for existing savers, with little sign of this slowing down. This means all savers would be wise to keep checking the rate they are getting, and to switch to improve returns when they are no longer competitive. “With almost 50% of easy-access accounts paying 0.5% or less, and the best-paying 1.55%, it’s easy to see why so many need to switch.” Notice accounts Despite the Bank of England cutting rates to 0.5% in 2009, there were three providers offering savers 3.5% – more than twice that on the best accounts today. And, what’s more, they did not expect customers to lock their money away for years in a fixed-rate bond. Anyone who took out Secure Trust Bank’s 60-day notice account (issue 2) has actually had a very good deal. Back in 2009 it paid a table-topping 3.52% on balances over £1,000. Today it is closed to new customers, and when that happens banks usually let the rate fall to a miserable level. But to Secure Trust’s credit it continues to pay 1.99% to existing customers. That may not sound much, but it’s more than any bank is paying on notice accounts and would be at the top of our tables if it were available to new customers. It’s not so good news for the people attracted to the 3.5% that West Bromwich building society was paying on its High Income Over 65 account at the time. In 2015, the society renamed it Monthly Income Saver, and it now pays 1.25%. It’s the same story at FirstSave, where the 90-day notice account was paying 3.5% in 2009. It has also been withdrawn, but pays 1.25% to savers who continue to keep their money there. Neither is terrible, given today’s prevailing rates, but not great either. Customers might want to shift their money to today’s best notice accounts, which are the 1.75% deal from Secure Trust and the 1.81% from Al Rayan. Savers who trusted ICICI Bank may be feeling more miffed. In 2009 it featured heavily in our best-buy tables with its internet-only HiSave account paying 2.95% interest. But today that pays only 0.5%. Its web page still says “earn a high rate of interest”, which must be galling to account holders. The same bank is paying 1.4% interest to new customers who open a HiSave Super Savings account. Customers with the old HiSave account should ask to be transferred. Cash Isas Nearly all the big names were battling for your Isa cash in 2009. Top of the table for instant-access cash Isas was Marks & Spencer Money, paying 3.1%. Even higher was the 3.35% from Halifax if you were happy to lock the money away for four years. It may not have seemed much of a deal at the time, but compared with today’s rates it was a miracle. The very best instant-access cash Isa, from Post Office Money, now pays just 1.45%, while if you lock your money away with Halifax now you will get just 2%. Customers who took out the M&S Isa at the time now get 1.3%. But the good news is that savers have been able to shelter far more in a cash Isa over the past seven years. In 2009, the maximum that could be placed in one was £3,600, but that has jumped to £15,240. However their attractions will diminish from April this year, because the new personal savings allowance will enable account holders to earn up to £1,000 interest tax-free if they are a 20% taxpayer, or £500 for a 40% taxpayer, without having to put the money in an Isa. Instant access accounts In 2009, the best branch-based instant-access savings account was Chelsea building society’s Rainy Day Savings 3, which paid 2.35% and could be opened with just a £10 deposit. Now it has been withdrawn and pays 1% to account holders who have left their money there. But while that sounds a low amount, if you are a new customer at Chelsea looking for an instant-access account it’s even worse – you will earn just 0.5% gross. Chelsea building society soon disappeared from our best-buy tables later in 2009 when it was almost wrecked by £41m in “potentially fraudulent loans”, mainly from its buy-to-let mortgage book. It merged with Yorkshire building society in 2010 and this year will close the last remaining branches carrying the Chelsea name. Meanwhile, Tesco Bank was the new kid on the block in 2009 in our best-buy table for its instant-access account paying 1.75% gross. Today the supermarket group’s instant-access account in the stores pays just 0.6% gross, although it does offer an internet-only account that pays 1.01%. Children’s accounts A scan down our best-buy table from March 2009 reveals a shockingly high figure. The Halifax was paying a fixed rate of 8% interest on its children’s regular saver account. Some will be surprised to find that it still pays the best rate on children’s savings, with the same regular savings account offering 6%. But the maximum you can save is just £100 a month. Current accounts Today the best interest to be earned is often on a bank current account rather than a savings account. In 2009 Abbey (remember them) was paying 5.37%, but for an introductory period only. Lloyds was in the best-buy table, even though it paid just 1% on its Classic Plus account. Abbey, of course, was taken over by Santander, and its 123 account, paying 3% on balances up to £20,000, has been a huge success. TSB, meanwhile, was carved out of Lloyds, and its Classic Plus account pays 5% interest – but sadly only on balances up to £2,000.\n",
      "Premier League and Championship clubs raise stakes with unprecedented spend Maybe it is an unintended consequence of Brexit. Maybe it was just the weather. But the fact is that in this summer’s transfer window not only was more money spent by Premier League clubs but more money was spent in England than ever before. The question many fans will now be asking is where that money goes next. According to research by the consultants Deloitte, Premier League clubs spent £1,165,000,000 in the transfer window that closed on Wednesday night, with fees ranging from the £89m Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba to the £1m Sunderland paid paid it for Donald Love. £445m of that total was spent on players from English clubs, roughly a 50% rise on last season. Further to that, spending on players in the Football League practically doubled, to a record £140m. The reasons for the rise in spending are not difficult to ascertain, with the advent of the new £5bn TV deal the primary culprit. “As has been the case for a number of years now, the increase in broadcast revenue is the principal driver of this spending power,” said Dan Jones, partner in the sports business group at Deloitte. “The increase in the value of these deals and the comparatively equal revenue distribution of these by the Premier League have again allowed clubs throughout the division to invest significantly in this summer’s market.” For those concerned about the health of the domestic game the key question is what will happen to any newfound riches. According to Deloitte, the answer is simple: more players. “Membership of the Premier League has never been as lucrative as it is today and as such we have seen this have knock-on effects in terms of the spending in the Championship,” says Jones. “This summer saw a record £215m gross spend by Championship clubs, more than twice the previous record, driven by the investment of recently relegated clubs seeking an immediate return to the Premier League as well as by that of ambitious Championship clubs seeking entry to the world’s richest football league.” These are unprecedented sums for the English football pyramid, although much of the spending is condensed at the top of the Championship. Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Norwich between them, the three clubs relegated from the Premier League in May, spent roughly £117m on new players, more than half the gross total in the Championship. Further to that the sale of four Newcastle players – Giorginio Wijnaldum, Moussa Sissoko, Andros Townsend and Daryl Janmaat – accounted almost entirely for the growth in transfer fees received by Football League clubs from their Premier League counterparts. “There are vast sums coming into the game and we want to see that shared more equitably throughout the footballing pyramid, right down to grassroots level,” Liam Thompson, a spokesperson for the Football Supporters’ Federation, said. “Concerted efforts from fans over the last few years have shown that clubs can do more with the money coming into the game. For example, Stoke City have continued to keep season ticket prices low as well as providing free coach travel to away games. A number of other clubs in the Premier League and Football League have frozen or reduced prices. This helps ensure live football is not out of reach of fans. The £30 [Premier] league-wide cap on away ticket prices is a significant victory for football supporters but we urge football fans to remain vigilant and continue to ask their clubs what they’re doing for their supporters.” The £30 rule does not apply in the Championship and fans of relegated sides are finding they can pay more for away travel in the second tier than in the Premier League. John Williams is an academic at Leicester University who specialises in the social impact of the national game. He suggests clubs could focus on this issue to bring in more support. “The fear, with Championship clubs in particular, is that they will spend whatever money they get to try and get into the Premier League, that’s the danger,” he said. “The riches are so great, they’ll spend the money on players, wages and whatever else they believe necessary to produce that dividend. “But there are a few other places the money could go though. Firstly, clubs could spend it on the women’s game. This would firstly stimulate local support locally, but it would also show that clubs are working for the public good and for inclusion. It would also be a good investment as the women’s game is growing and is no longer sniffed at by big clubs. “It would also make sense to work hard on young supporters,” he says. “We know that the temptation is for young supporters to identify with much larger clubs, to wear their stuff locally. Anything a smaller club can do to reduce the price of their own goods is a good thing. Reduce the price of kits, reduce the price of tickets, see how far you can push it down, make it real.” One final tweak that could be made, Williams says, is one adopted by the Premier League champions. “Maybe do the thing that seems to have proven surprisingly popular here in Leicester. The owners chose a couple of games and gave any supporter who came to the match a free donut or soft drink. When my students have interviewed fans since, they don’t see it as a crass stunt but as a sign that the owners care. Why not choose a couple of matches and show that we care and you’ll get something that you like too? Why not spread the love?” • This article was amended on 2 September 2016. An earlier version said Sunderland paid Everton £1m for Steven Pienaar. In fact he had been released by Everton and Sunderland paid no fee.\n",
      "A less than special one at Old Trafford as Mourinho and United’s woes continue It is a moot point whether Arsenal fans have any right to make the claim that he is “not special any more” after what José Mourinho would describe as their specialising in failure years, but they know what needles Manchester United and their manager. The home side have not been special enough this season, Mourinho has even begun blaming his success in the past for the raised expectations that are currently going unfulfilled at Old Trafford, and if United are back in the realms of the ordinary there is no longer anything special about this fixture other than its history. Arsenal looked at all times as though they would be happy with a point, and though they left it late that is what they took. The story in short was that Mourinho dropped Wayne Rooney after claiming he has looked after pencils more carefully than England protect their internationals, and in the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic through suspension Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial missed their chance to sharpen the United attack The home side began well enough, with Antonio Valencia, Paul Pogba and Rashford all making inroads down the right wing, but with no Ibrahimovic to aim for in the middle their attempted crosses were easily dealt with. United tried to do most of the attacking, Arsenal were content to merely keep possession much of the time, yet it was clear throughout that in Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Özil the visitors had players who could create something from nothing with a single feint or pass. That is an ability United presently lack, and though Martial and Juan Mata did begin to show up a little more forcefully towards the end of the first half, as both forced saves from Petr Cech, when the score was unchanged after an hour Mourinho acquiesced to the Stretford End’s request and sent Rooney on. The script now demanded that everyone’s favourite wedding gatecrasher would put a week of lurid headlines behind him by supplying the winning goal and perhaps Arsenal thought so too, for when Ander Herrera pulled a cross back from the right the defence tracked Rooney and left Mata expensively unmarked by the penalty spot. Still, Rooney had only been on the pitch for five minutes and not only had United made a breakthrough but Mourinho heard his name being enthusiastically chanted around the stadium. Rooney did not quite manage to transform the game, it remained resolutely low key, though while United were winning he put himself about quite effectively, was hungry for the ball and might have claimed an assist for a second goal had Pogba managed better contact with a probing cross along the six-yard line. Marcos Rojo should really have made the points safe from Daley Blind’s cross but missed the target with a free header at the far post, leaving United to cling on to their narrow lead. Despite Mourinho sending on Morgan Schneiderlin for Mata to try to lock up the midfield already containing Michael Carrick, they failed to manage it. What does all this prove, apart from the suspicion that Arsène Wenger should probably seek to involve Olivier Giroud and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain earlier if he hopes to improve his shocking record against Mourinho teams in competitive matches? Arsenal will be encouraged by gaining a draw from an unpromising situation, and the old adage about champion teams picking up points when not playing well will most likely be wheeled out, though neither of these teams looked like champions. Arsenal are going to have to do better than one attempt on target in 90 minutes to achieve their ambitions, and the possibility exists that a greater commitment to attack could have brought a greater reward. “In years gone by we might have lost this game,” Theo Walcott claimed afterwards, revealing a surprising timidity within the Arsenal outlook. The whole point about coming to Old Trafford these days is that this is not the United of years gone by. Teams with title aspirations have to look at a defence containing Rojo and Phil Jones and try to exploit weaknesses. Even the notion that Carrick automatically improves United took a knock with the Arsenal equaliser. Initially it appeared that Carrick’s inclusion had successfully freed up Pogba and allowed Herrera to operate in a more advanced role, yet that impression faded quite early. United were left with the disappointment of a third successive home draw, achieved in almost exactly the same manner as the first of the sequence, when Stoke City claimed a late share of the points at the start of October. “We have been dominating games, making an amazing number of chances, but from our last two home games we got just two points,” Mourinho said beforehand. Make that three points now from three home games. This time without the domination or the amazing number of chances. Nothing special, in other words, for all Mourinho’s protestations about luck.\n",
      "Think Leicester will fold against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal? Think again If all eyes have admiringly and disbelievingly been on Leicester City for a great deal of this Premier League season, the focus is about to get that little bit sharper. England’s buccaneering pacesetters have in front of them a large hurdle that has all the makings of an important signpost in this remarkable campaign. Within the space of 12 days Leicester confront three difficult assignments. “Three unbelievable matches,” emphasised Claudio Ranieri. Liverpool at home on Tuesday, followed by Manchester City away and Arsenal away. That little flurry includes the only two sides to have beaten them in the Premier League so far this season, with the bookies’ favourite to finish top sandwiched between. “It’s important to be ready,” added Ranieri, making all the right noises about his team feeling strong at the moment. Come teatime on Valentine’s Day, at the end of this mini-series, it will be very revealing to see if he can still make light and chuckle away at the questions about Leicester’s title hopes. Think they are bound to falter? Think again. Of course, this being unscripted sport none of us have the slightest clue really, but the big positive Leicester have going for them is they were supposed to drop off a cliff once already this season and they managed to maintain their footing. Not so long ago, beginning in late November, a bunch of tricky fixtures loomed over the course of a testing month, including Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool and Manchester City. Leicester came unstuck in only one of those fixtures – losing narrowly at Anfield. They began that period top by one point, and ended it second only on goal difference, so any expectations that they would have a serious wobble were adeptly answered. Leicester’s fortune in keeping so many crucial players fit enough to play the majority of the games has given them a great foundation. Naturally, any serious injuries will test Ranieri’s resources, but the purchases of Daniel Amartey and Demarai Gray during January are promising ones. Judging by the way most of the summer signings have shone, with N’Golo Kanté, Christian Fuchs, Robert Huth (who made his successful loan from Stoke a permanent move) and Shinji Okazaki all becoming mainstays in the team, the manager has shown a great touch for bringing in players who are ready to adapt quickly to the fast, determined tempo that has served Leicester so well. Joining a settled and optimistic dressing room, the vibes around the team continue to be upbeat and fiercely driven. Although the Premier League summit remains, quite rightly, their priority, Leicester ought to be keeping a eye on the distance between them and the team fifth in the table, currently Manchester United. Could there be a greater confidence boost in the last few weeks of the season than confirming a place in the Champions League? The gap over United at the moment is 10 points. Keeping a comfortable cushion should be a huge incentive, because, irrespective of how the title challenge ends up, a Champions League position would in itself be a staggering achievement. It has been an age since a team from the Midlands has been represented in Europe’s elite competition. None of Leicester’s current players were even born around the golden age in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa flourished. More recently, following the modernisation of the European Cup from the 1990s onwards, English football’s modern history has no precedent for a club outside the traditional power bases, one without a domestic title on its honours board, qualifying for the Champions League. It has never happened before. When English football first saw its number of qualification spots increased to four, during the 2001-02 season, it was reasonable to imagine a greater spread of teams could gain access to the prosperous, luxurious, promised land of the Champions League. In reality the opposite occurred. Since 2001-02, a Champions League ticket has been claimed 57 times by English clubs (this includes a bonus spot, when Liverpool won the competition in 2005 so even though they finished outside the top four they were allowed special dispensation to join in). The usual suspects – Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City – have taken up 53 of those 57 slots. Outside that list of heavyweights, Newcastle qualified twice (failing once to reach the group stage), and Everton (also failing to reach the groups) and Tottenham once each. Back in 2001-02, Leicester City were anything but one of those clubs hungrily eyeing up a Champions League position. They were relegated, the first team to drop out of the Premier League that season, and finished in bottom place. It was a doleful and worrying way to bid farewell to their ancestral home, Filbert Street. With spiralling debts as they endeavoured to pay for a new stadium, they went into administration. The weeks ahead offer tantalising opportunity. A shot at history. The chance to do something nobody thought possible when Ranieri was appointed to take over from Nigel Pearson continues to be astounding.\n",
      "Bob Bradley born in the USA but fully immersing himself in Swansea City From talking about watching Jack to a King, the documentary about Swansea’s City rise through the leagues, to recognising the need to earn the respect of the supporters, and expressing his determination to finally make his mark in the Premier League, Bob Bradley made all the right noises on the day he was officially unveiled as Francesco Guidolin’s successor. A gregarious character, Bradley set the tone with his opening answer as he made it clear that the first American to manage in the Premier League is much more interested in reviving the fortunes of the Welsh club than blazing a trail for his fellow countrymen. “I’m honoured to be at Swansea City Football Club,” Bradley said. “The American side I can cover in 30 seconds and then we can push that out the door. “With football in the United States we’ve always understood that we have to earn respect. When I was with the national team, every time we got the chance to play in Europe, the players and I would understand it was one more day where we could show what the game was like in our country. So if in some way this helps, I’m proud of what I’ve been able to do. “But this bit about pioneer and all the rest? I’m not an American manager, I’m a football manager. So now, when I come here, I realise there is not one person in Swansea who could care less what anybody in the United States thinks at the moment. They care about their football club. And I’m here to give everything I have for the fans and the club and I couldn’t be more excited about that chance.” Aged 58, Bradley has a rich CV that includes managing at club level in his homeland, in Norway and in France. He also took charge of his country for five years and, in a role that could not have been more challenging, was appointed as the Egypt manager in the immediate aftermath of the Arab spring. The way in which Bradley lost his job as the USA manager clearly still rankles. There was a long pause when it was put to Bradley that Jürgen Klinsmann, the man who replaced him in 2011, had been very complimentary in the wake of Swansea’s decision to turn to him. “From the day I got fired by the US I’ve not said one thing publicly. I don’t appreciate the way it was done,” Bradley said. “I’m glad that Jürgen said some nice things now; when he did commentary on the 2010 World Cup he was already jockeying for the job. “So I’ve shut my mouth, continued to support the team because I, of course, want to see the team do well – Michael [Bradley’s son] is the captain. So if [Klinsmann] has said something in a nice way I appreciate it. And if at some point he chooses to try to work again outside the US, I wish him all the best.” The way in which Swansea handled Guidolin’s dismissal has upset some of the club’s supporters. Bradley made no attempt to disguise the fact that he spoke to Huw Jenkins, Swansea’s chairman, and Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, the club’s American owners before last Saturday’s defeat against Liverpool, which proved to be the Italian’s last match in charge. “But at the end of both of those interviews I said – because I’ve been through this before – ‘Let’s be clear about one thing, I hope you win and I hope you keep winning.’” While Bradley said that he accepts some Swansea fans will be “angry” he promised to “do everything to earn their respect”. In fairness to Bradley, he came across as a man who has done his homework on the culture around the club and not just the players he has inherited. “I know enough about Swansea City Football Club. I had seen Jack to a King before this week. Most of all what I know is that we have a club with a soul, a club that has real passion and real supporters. For me that’s special.” At the same time Bradley is no fool. He knows that he has to win people over and the only way he will do that is with victories. “When the talk is about proving yourself, yes, I understand that. There will be sceptics. But I don’t care. I love football and I believe in my ability. I am going to come here and every day step on the field with the same kind of energy and passion and commitment I had the rest of my career. Whatever happens, happens and after that, people can say or write whatever the flip they want.”\n",
      "Chelsea 3-3 Everton, Newcastle 2-1 West Ham and more: clockwatch – as it happened • Chelsea 3-3 Everton • Manchester City 4-0 Crystal Palace • Southampton 3-0 West Brom And with that, I’m off. It’s been special. Bye! John Terry speaks: A lot of teams would have thrown the towel in but the fight, the desire from the team … unbelievable, and unlucky not to win the game [MBMer spits out tea]. Was it offside? I don’t know. I don’t really care. It was my first one this season. Scott Murray is all over the Aston Villa v Leicester City game here. Deja vu dept November 28: Everton score incredible last-minute goal to take 3-2 lead in crazy game at Bournemouth. Final score: 3-3 January 16: Everton score incredible last-minute goal to take 3-2 lead in crazy game at Chelsea. Final score: 3-3 That John Terry offside equaliser was scored in the 53rd second of the eighth of the allotted seven minutes of stoppage time. Final score: Newcastle have beaten West Ham 2-1! Final score: Chelsea and Everton have drawn 3-3. Terry opened the scoring and he’s closed it too, with a late, late equaliser for Everton! And it’s a clever backheel flick as the ball headed between his legs! And, what’s more … he was way offside when Costa flicked on! Middlesbrough have conceded a goal! Bristol City have scored a last-minute winner! Aden Flint with the goal! Ooof! Willian’s low drive across goal whistles just wide, having taken a deflection on its way. Meanwhile at Newcastle there’ll be six minutes of stoppage time, and at Stamford Bridge they’re going to have seven! Final score: Bournemouth have beaten Norwich 3-0. Final score: Southampton have beaten West Brom 3-0. Stinker of the day: Leyton Orient have won two second half penalties against Exeter … and Jay Simpson has missed them both – one hit the post, the other saved. They trail 1-3. Final score: Manchester City have beaten Crystal Palace 4-0. A corner from the right is cleared back to the taker and re-crossed to the far post, where two Everton players are competing with each other, and Funes Mori gets in front of Lukaku to score with a flying sidefoot volley! Defending, anyone? Oooh, a cross from the right is only just too high for Lukaku in the middle as Everton look to snatch a win at Stamford Bridge. If a 5-0 away defeat was enough for the fans to be refunded, logically they should actually be paid for enduring this: “I don’t understand this “reimburse travelling fans after a poor performance” business,” complains Peter Oh. “What’s next? A surcharge for a better-than-expected away result? Modern football … sigh.” Aguero, on a hat-trick, runs clear from the half-way line as City break. You’d have thought he’d only have eyes for goal, but instead he notices Silva’s supporting run and passes to him instead, and the Spaniard has time to control the ball before scoring from six yards! Derby are now 3-0 down at home to Birmingham, Makel Kieftenbeld with their latest. Boro remain at 0-0 against Bristol City. The teams for today’s late kick-off: Aston Villa: Bunn, Bacuna, Okore, Lescott, Cissokho, Westwood, Gana, Veretout, Ayew, Kozak, Gil. Subs: Guzan, Richards, Clark, Sinclair, Richardson, Lyden, Gestede. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs, Drinkwater, Kante, Mahrez, Okazaki, Albrighton, Vardy. Subs: De Laet, King, Gray, Ulloa, Wasilewski, Schwarzer, Inler. Referee: Roger East. It’s over a year since Palace last conceded three away goals. And guess where they did that? The home side have been considerably superior today, and the scoreline reflects it. Charlie Daniels raids down the left, Afobe meets the cross six yards out and he can hardly miss. And doesn’t. Miss, that is. In the big game in League One, Burton are now 2-0 up at Coventry, and it looks very much like they will remain on top of the league tonight. Coventry are, as it stands, unbeaten at home this season. Not, though, for long. Tadic comes on and scores almost instantly for the second time in a week! Davis passes into the area and Tadic crashes in a first-time left-foot shot from an acute angle! A long delay at Stamford Bridge, where Oviedo has been receiving treatment for a while, and has now been loaded onto a stretcher. Funes Bori comes on. City will be, temporarily at least, joint top of the league at the final whistle having extended their lead over Palace to three, Agüero being presented with a tap-in after Touré found De Bruyne in the area, and the Belgian crossed low! What a turnaround! Fábregas plays a one-two with Costa and shoots low from the edge of the area, his effort taking a deflection and bobbling inside the near post with Howard nowhere! Chelsea have been huffing and puffing ever since they went two down, and Howard excelled to deny Fábregas, but he doesn’t look quite so clever here, as he hares out of his area as Costa races Jagielka for the ball. The defender I think got a tiny touch, Howard certainly didn’t, and Costa taps into the empty net! Bad news for Derby, who have fallen a goal down at home to Birmingham. Hull are streaking to victory and as it stands they go third, though first-place Boro remain goalless against Bristol City. Not that I can think of. He replaced Pedro Obiang. Chelsea fall further behind! Lennon picks out Baines, and he passes into and across the area, Mirallas controls with his left foot, bringing the ball back inside, and then shoots also with his left foot, inside the near post! The penalty flies in off the inside of the right-hand post! Penalty for Bournemouth! Obidja is cursing and scowling, having punished for a trip on Marc Pugh, whose fall looked remarkable dramatic to my eyes. Terry is not responsible for the day’s most idiotic defending, mind. That prize will surely go to the author of the back-pass from which Jelavic just nipped in and brought West Ham back into the game at St James’ Park! Everton hit the post! Barkley with the effort, hitting the near post from the left side of the area. Those are superlative own goal stylings from John Terry. The ball is worked to Baines on the left touchline, and his powercross is met by Terry at the near post, who volleys it right-footed into his left leg, with which he backheels into his own net! Oooh! Bournemouth should have extended their lead within 30 seconds of the restart, as Pugh tricks his way into space inside the penalty area but his low shot is saved! Half-time double substitution: West Brom bring on Brunt and Rondon for Fletcher and Olsson as they attempt to claw back a 2-0 deficit at Southampton. Scottish weather latest: That’s a first-half hat-trick for Abel Hernández of Hull. “Will the Charlton players be doing another refund for the travelling fans?” asks Tom Harp. “Could get costly by the end of the season.” Tuesday Saturday Today’s Premier League games have an aggregate score, as it stands, of 11-1. A good day so far for the home sides. The half-time whistles are busily shrieking. Four of the five top-flight games are done, for now. Ooooh! Rudd streaks from his area and trips Afobe, and the referee is immediately surrounded by Bournemouth players demanding a red card! but he was heading away from goal, and there were a couple of defenders in the neighbourhood, so he’s given only a yellow. Palace have given City a decent examination here, but it doesn’t look like they’re going to get anything out of it. Agüero shoots from 25 yards, and it beats Hennessey at the near post after taking a deflection off Dann. Oooh! West Ham should have pulled a goal back at Newcastle, but when picked out by Payet’s free kick Valencia somehow fluffs his shot! Final cricket update: England have won the match by seven wickets, and with it the series. Goal-line clearance! Southampton nearly went 3-0 up, but McClean popped up on the line to divert Targett’s first-time left-foot drive to safety! It might have been postbound rather than goalbound, but even so, fine defending there young man! Ward-Prowse sends the keeper the wrong way, and rolls the ball low to his left to double the Saints’ lead. Targett is bundled over by Craig Dawson (though to me it looked like Dawson was bundled over by Targett). Whatever, it’s a penalty. At the Etihad, Cabaye’s free-kick is athletically tipped round the post by Hart. In the cricket, England have collapsed to 71-3. They need three to win, so should scrape through. “As I watch West Ham meekly let Championship hopefuls Newcastle walk all over them, it begs the question why the Premier League has subjected half the league to two away games in four days?” moans Dan Bryant. “First set of midweek fixtures all season and they gift the likes of City, Newcastle, Chelsea and Liverpool etc with doubled up home games. And of course, every home team (bar Chelsea) is already winning. Why not just do home and away like normal? Why change it this week of all weeks?” Um, don’t know, really. I’m sure there’s an innocent explanation. Confusion! Ward-Prowse takes a corner and Myhill comes out to punch it, misses completely and the ball hits him in the side and plops straight down to earth, five yards out. To his very great fortune, it lands very near a defender, who wallops clear. So the only goalless top-flight game is at Chelsea, where Everton look to be doing a certain amount of bus-parking. Diego Costa has just been caught offside. Confusion! Hart collects the ball after a Palace corner, runs to the edge of the area, kicks it into the back of the nearest Palace played and Delaney, I think, hits a first-time shot over the bar. The referee gave a free kick, I think. Not sure why. Another home goal! Delph takes aim with his left foot, probably 35 yards out, and it flies hard and low towards the near post. Hennessey got two hands on it, should have stopped it, but, um, didn’t. Penalty? No! Norwich’s Russell Martin pretty much rugby tackles Charlie Daniels, who makes the mistake of not going straight down when two arms appear around his waist, and by the time he does crumple a moment later the referee doesn’t think he needed to. A super, long crossfield pass from Shelvey picks out the rampaging Janmaat on the right, he crosses and Wijnaldum converts having escaped the attentions of Collins. Lovely goal in a very old-fashioned English style. Today’s is Ward-Prowse’s second in the league, in his 47th appearance. Given the dead-ball excellence he’s just demonstrated, he should have more. In cricket news, England are 10 runs from victory in the third Test against South Africa, but have just lost their first wicket (it’s been reviewed, but Hales looks plummish). The Championship strugglers are already struggling: second-bottom Charlton are 1-0 down at Hull, and rock-bottom Bolton are 1-0 down at Nottingham Forest, with the added blow of goalkeeper Ben Amos being sent off. That’s three of the five top-flight home sides in the lead. A left-wing cross from Pugh is cleared, but Bournemouth reclaim possession, work it back to Pugh and this time his cross finds Gosling at the far post, who heads in from five yards! There aren’t many better names in football at the moment than Max Power, and this sounds very much like an excellent example of nominative determanism. It’s not his first chance of the day, either. He had a low shot saved, in the fifth minute, and then he scored in the sixth. Shelvey’s pass zipped to the edge of the area, where it was laid back into Perez’s path and he hit a first-time shot into the right corner! It’s a free kick from five yards outside the penalty area, towards its left corner, and Ward-Prowse slams it into the top left corner with the goalkeeper nowhere! Meanwhile at Newcastle, James Collins is already limping quite badly. Impossible miss for Palace! Or save, if you’re feeling charitable! Joe Hart has kept out an absolute sitter, Damien Delaney with a headed chance at the back stick, seven yards out and completely unmarked. It’s 3pm. Let’s play! Lewis Grabban “said to be unwell” today, so unable to play for Bournemouth against Norwich, the team he just left. Which is convenient. … and out they come! Players are emerging from dressing rooms and congregating in tunnels. Nearly there. Are those strictly necessary? Today’s big transfer news has seen Charlie Austin sign for Southampton, for a rumoured £4m. Great signing, surely. Results so far today: Gary Hooper scores both goals as Sheffield Wednesday beat Leeds 2-0, and the final whistle has just gone on Tottenham 4-1 Sunderland. That’s four in six now for Hooper, who remains on loan from striker-seeking Norwich. “Afternoon Simon,” writes sometime volunteer Scotland correspondent Simon McMahon. Afternoon. “Game of the day in Scotland takes place, eh, last night at Tannadice where Dundee United continued to build confidence after last weeks cup win against League One Airdrie by only shipping 4 goals against league leaders Celtic. Just watch us go now. Other SPFL fixtures are Hearts v Motherwell, Kilmarnock v Inverness and, after passing an early pitch inspection, St. Johnstone v Hamilton. A number of games in the lower leagues are off, but in League Two Annan, fresh from their stunning cup win over SPFL Hamilton, face East Fife, still the only team to have won the Scottish Cup when playing outside the top division (in 1938, since you ask).” Excellent. That’s a big fat tick in the don’t-totally-ignore-Scotland box. A managerial pre-match interview distilled to its very essence. Good effort. So Jonjo Shelvey starts for Newcastle, and Victor Moses is in West Ham’s squad for the first time since 5 December.

Another Saturday afternoon yawns before us like a wild chasm of possibility. Untold excitement awaits (I’m an optimist). Here are this afternoon’s English Football League fixtures. I’ve searched high and low but in vain for key games from other leagues – there are 3pm GMT kick-offs in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, Israel and Algeria, but I can’t find a single one that seems particularly vital. Do feel free to point out my unforgivable ignorance, though. In the meantime, this is what we’ve got: Premier League Bournemouth v Norwich (preview) Chelsea v Everton (preview) Man City v Crystal Palace (preview) Newcastle v West Ham (preview) Southampton v West Brom (preview) Championship Blackburn Rovers v Brighton & Hove Albion Bristol City v Middlesbrough Derby County v Birmingham City Huddersfield Town v Fulham Hull City v Charlton Athletic Ipswich Town v Preston North End Milton Keynes Dons v Reading Nottingham Forest v Bolton Wanderers Rotherham United v Queens Park Rangers Wolverhampton Wanderers v Cardiff City Middlesbrough’s recent league results (in the last two months they have won eight and drawn one, with an aggregate scoe of 13-0. Yes, nil) are astonishingly awesome. They are, as a result, five points clear at the top of the Championship with a game in hand on every team in the league except 18th-place Blackburn, and two games in hand on some. Today they visit third-bottom Bristol City who, in the two months in which Boro haven’t conceded, haven’t kept a clean sheet and have won only once, and who sacked their manager, Steve Cotterill, this week. Three more points look on the cards. What this does is heap enormous pressure on the chasing pack. Burnley did the business last night, beating Brentford, but Hull and Derby both play this afternoon, at home to second-bottom Charlton and eighth-place Birmingham respectively. You’d certainly have one, and probably both – Derby are a little out of sorts, not having won in three matches, and Birmingham’s away record is pretty good, though they’ve now not won on their travels since 7 November – down as home wins, but even with 20 games remaining they can’t let Boro pull further away, and that can induce wild panic. Meanwhile Brighton, who were level at the top with Boro just before Christmas, undefeated in their first 21 matches, have taken one point from their last five and head to Blackburn clinging desperately on to the last play-off place. League One Blackpool v Scunthorpe United Bradford City v Oldham Athletic Bury v Walsall Colchester United v Sheffield United Coventry City v Burton Albion Doncaster Rovers v Gillingham Peterborough United v Southend United Rochdale v Fleetwood United Shrewsbury Town v Barnsley Swindon Town v Crewe Alexandra Wigan Athletic v Chesterfield Top-of-the-table Burton have two games in hand on most of their rivals, and one on the rest, but could finish the afternoon in fourth. They travel to fourth-placed Coventry, who would overtake them with a win. But even if Coventry do win they could still only end up third, with Gillingham, who visit 12th-place Doncaster, and Walsall, who travel to 14th-place Bury, hoping to end the day above them. League Two Accrington Stanley v Portsmouth AFC Wimbledon v Mansfield Town Barnet v Carlisle United Crawley Town v Notts County Dagenham & Redbridge v Northampton Town Hartlepool United v Wycombe Wanderers Leyton Orient v Exeter City Luton Town v Cambridge United Morecambe v Yeovil Town Plymouth Argyle v Stevenage York City v Newport County Third-place Oxford play fifth-place Bristol Rovers tomorrow, and without that there’s no truly outstanding fixture, with Accrington v Portsmouth – or seventh v fourth, if you prefer – the only meeting between two top 10 teams. Two of the bottom five play, with Newport travelling to bottom-place York. With Dagenham & Redbridge hosting second-place Northampton, victory for York could well take them off the foot of the table. Having said that, they’ve won only once in the league, losing 11, in the last four months, including at one stage a run of 10 defeats in 11 in all competitions, so probably shouldn’t get their hopes up.\n",
      "Arsenal and Leicester fans furious after date of February game switched Arsenal and Leicester fans have reacted with fury after their Premier League fixture at the Emirates was moved to Sunday from Saturday, four weeks before it was due to take place. The match between the top two was to have taken place on 13 February at 3pm but has been moved to Sunday 14 February after Sky decided they wanted to screen the potential title-decider. A Leicester fan group, called Union FS, suggested boycotting the first five minutes of the game in protest at the change. “‘Why? To make a point that without fans, there is no saleable product,” say the fan group. “Just 22 blokes kicking a ball around on some nicely cut grass. We would encourage Arsenal fans to join us with this, as they graciously did with Bayern Munich fans recently. “We appreciate that fans want to watch the game they have paid for, and rightly so, but this is an extraordinary issue and we would ask you to join us and make a one-off stand for all football fans.” The TV company said Leicester’s unexpected title challenge had prompted the change. Fans of both clubs are furious at the prospect of being left out of pocket for travel costs. A Premier League spokesman said: “We always seek to give fans a minimum of six weeks’ notice of fixture changes. It is only on extremely rare occasions we don’t meet that aspiration during the normal course of the season. “We are in discussions with Arsenal and Leicester City to see what can be done to help fans affected by this scheduling change.”\n",
      "Leicester’s Dannys, Drinkwater and Simpson, seek sweetest triumph at Old Trafford The two Dannys always dreamed of eventually proving Manchester United wrong. They had long hoped to jog a few memories by reminding the Stretford End of what might have been but neither man envisaged it happening quite like this. When Danny Drinkwater takes up his position in central midfield and Danny Simpson stations himself at right-back at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon Leicester City will be one win away from the most startling of Premier League title triumphs. To clinch English football’s biggest domestic prize back at the place where it all began for the pair would make things even more special. The prospects of such an evocative victory may be complicated by Manchester United’s desperate, against-the-odds scramble for a top-four place but even Louis van Gaal will know better than to underestimate Claudio Ranieri’s team. Or their two United old boys. In many ways, the two Dannys constitute a hopelessly romantic, wonderfully feelgood story but if Drinkwater’s journey since being shown the door by United more than fulfils this narrative, Simpson’s progress has been somewhat darker. The 29-year-old made eight senior appearances for Sir Alex Ferguson’s team but spent much of his time on the Old Trafford books farmed out on loan – to Royal Antwerp, Sunderland (where he helped Roy Keane’s side win promotion from the Championship), Ipswich Town, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. Eventually, in 2010, Simpson was transferred to Newcastle, where he played a big part in their return to the Premier League under Chris Hughton. Aware Hughton’s successor, Alan Pardew, was keen to replace him with an “upgrade”, a defender who had courted controversy by leaving Stephanie Ward, the mother of his baby daughter, for an ill-starred, volatile romance with the singer and X-Factor judge Tulisa subsequently moved on to Queens Park Rangers. Another promotion was followed by another transfer, this time to Leicester, and last season’s relegation fight. A few months after the move, in January 2015, Simpson was charged with assaulting Ward. Shortly after Nigel Pearson’s then side confirmed a most unexpected relegation escape, he was convicted and sentenced to 300 hours of community service. The judge told him he had been fortunate to escape a six-month custodial sentence for throttling his former partner and, with many Leicester fans demanding his sacking, he was forced to beg the club’s hierarchy for one last chance. Magistrates were told that Simpson was straddling Ward on the living room floor with both hands around her throat when police arrived at her house and officers said they heard screams, crying and then a choking sound before finding Ward gasping for breath. The court heard that Simpson was pulled away from Ward. Simpson found himself spending football-free days variously steam‑ironing bin-bagged clothes in a charity shop, escorting people with mental health problems to the toilet and teaching them to play bingo. “It helped me grow,” he said recently. “I was in this football bubble and community service broke that. It made me think. It humbled me. It was a massive eye-opener.” Only time will tell if this particular leopard has truly changed his spots. Pardew, though, is delighted to see a full-back he had once regarded as a Championship level player undermined by a Jack the Lad persona, not only prospering professionally but apparently getting his life back on track. “We released Danny from Newcastle thinking we could get something better in his position,” says Crystal Palace’s manager. “But here he is in a position to win the title, attracting admiration and envy. I take my hat off to him.” Drinkwater, three years Simpson’s junior, was part of a Manchester United youth system that also hot-housed Matty James, another Leicester midfielder. James, something of a forgotten man after rupturing a cruciate ligament last May, was often preferred in midfield by Pearson but his injury created a big opportunity for Drinkwater under Ranieri. Drinkwater has seized it so assuredly he has even forced his way into the England squad – a feat few would have thought possible when he quit United for an uncertain future. Like Simpson he came from the Manchester area – Altrincham to the right-back’s Eccles – grew up supporting United and, again as with Simpson, surprised teachers by obtaining nine good GCSEs. Drinkwater’s Old Trafford class reached the 2007 FA Youth Cup final, losing on penalties to Liverpool. Of that team Danny Welbeck is at Arsenal, James Chester at West Bromwich Albion and Corry Evans with Blackburn but other squad members have drifted out of football. “Some of the guys from that time don’t play professionally any more,” said Drinkwater, aka Leicester’s “puppet master”, recently. “They play Sunday League and I know that could have been me. I didn’t have as good an attitude as I needed but you learn an awful lot when you see players falling out of football. “I still speak to a few of those boys and you can sense the disappointment in them. But a lot of making a breakthrough at big clubs is down to luck.” Despite not formally leaving Old Trafford until he was 21 Drinkwater never made the first team and began life on the loan beat at 18, experiencing stints at Huddersfield Town, Cardiff City, Watford and Barnsley. The enduring potential of a youngster determined to emulate Paul Scholes was ultimately spotted by Pearson, who transplanted him to Leicester, then struggling in the Championship. Underwhelmed, Drinkwater was “gutted” by United’s decision but now sees that a move which brought him to his “lowest” ebb ultimately changed and matured him. This metamorphosis did not surprise Keith Hill, his manager at Barnsley. “I always thought Danny would become a Premier League player,” says Hill, now at Rochdale. “He was superb.” Old ties still bind the midfielder to his original habitat and he continues to take a close interest in United. “I’ve always supported them,” he said recently. “But I guess there’s a part of me that wants to prove people they’re wrong.” Simpson still relishes memories of training alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney et al. “I tried to base my game on Gary Neville’s,” he says. “United was a dream.” Now an even bigger fantasy seems about to come true.\n",
      "Five of the best new films in the UK 1 Silence (15) (Martin Scorsese, 2016, Mex/Tai/US) 161 mins Scorsese is in repentance mode with this austere, spiritual drama. Two Portuguese missionaries (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) are smuggled into 17th-century Japan, where Christians are violently persecuted, in search of a padre who’s apparently gone native. What follows is an earnest study of faiths – in crisis and in conflict. Non-believers may tire of its longueurs, but it’s a film of depth and devotion. Out on Sun 2 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12A) (Gareth Edwards, 2016, US) 134 mins The prospect of fresh Star Wars characters, locations and hardware is all many punters need. But despite the retrograde male domination (Felicity Jones excepted), this spinoff is pacy, action-packed, and rendered with a conviction that most effects movies lack. 3 Assassin’s Creed (12A) (Justin Kurzel, 2016, UK/Fra/HK/US) 115 mins The bestselling video game becomes a Matrix-like epic, throwing Michael Fassbender between high-tech prison movie and Spanish Inquisition swashbuckler. The complex mythology takes some explaining (it’s all to do with a secret Assassins v Templars war), but the action scenes are exhilarating, with rooftop and horseback chases that look agreeably non-digital. Out on Sun 4 The Son Of Joseph (12A) (Eugène Green, 2016, Bel/Fra) 113 mins This oddball French comedy contains hints of both Robert Bresson and Wes Anderson in its deadpan story of a young man seeking the identity of his father. Drawing on a range of cultural references, not least the Bible, it’s sophisticated without being pretentious. 5 Why Him? (15) (John Hamburg, 2016, US) 111 mins It’s not going to win any awards, but this Meet The Parents-style bromance is funny enough to pass muster. James Franco was possibly the only option for the part of an overbearing zillionaire dude, whose proposal to Bryan Cranston’s daughter is not exactly welcomed.\n",
      "Louis van Gaal’s time at Manchester United is surely up after new low Lads, it’s Manchester United. Or at least, it’s something that looks a bit like them, United at one remove, a United‑style product. On a chilly, slow-burn, ultimately raucous afternoon at White Hart Lane the contrast between the collection of energetically baffled red shirts currently representing English football’s champion club of the past 25 years, and the team Alex Ferguson could send out to feast on their opponents with a flick of his finger was so pronounced as to be more or less completely meaningless This was instead a kind of alternate red and white world, Manchester United glimpsed through a psychedelic prism. Weird, late, jumbled up. Expensively acquired, dotted with youth, charged with pace. But somehow also lost in their own ponderous moments, like a collection of dying flies trying to batter their way out of a fluorescent tube. There have been a few disjointed, downright odd days in the recent history of Manchester United. The competition is pretty stiff here. But this has to be up there, an afternoon to make you question not simply whether Louis van Gaal should carry on as manager of the club, but whether anything could actually be gained from getting rid of him, an existential-crisis 3-0 defeat for a United team so devoid of urgency and bite the only emotion it seems to inspire is a kind of humorous relief, a perverse kind of weirdness-fascination. United started brightly here, before descending slowly, but inevitably into entropy. No doubt in those opening 20 minutes Spurs were a little spooked by United’s late arrival for the game, the time to reflect on and digest Leicester’s victory at Sunderland , a result that took a great deal of heat out of this game. Even in victory Tottenham ended the day seven points behind. Leicester have been top or joint top on all but four Premier League weekends since the 21 November. Oh for a more open league. In effect there was more riding on this fixture for United, who came here with a fair chance of edging Manchester City for fourth place. By the end both the result and the performance felt like the final, rasping breaths of their league season that has spluttered and sparked without ever seeming to thrum into life. What now for Van Gaal, who seems to be wheeled out at the end of games such as these as much out of a perverse, vicarious fascination with what he might say next? Even for a Van Gaal sympathiser it is almost impossible to make a case for keeping him in place for the final year of his contract. Not because any team has a right to win trophies, or because it is a disgrace to come fifth in a competitive league. The positives of the Van Gaal interlude were on show here in a team containing three players aged 20 or younger. Anthony Martial might have opened the scoring here in the second half. He looks a wonderfully pure modern footballer, blessed with speed, power and driving intelligence. Timothy Fosu-Mensah is a hugely impressive teenage powerhouse, and was United’s best player until he limped off. It is simply that United continue to play with so little verve and joy. There is no sense here of a team emerging, of a shape and a purpose being found, simply of a collection of parts poking out in various places, occasionally offering the odd misleading sparkle of hope, before collapsing back into a froth of confusion. For 20 minutes Tottenham played like a team with a slow puncture. For 10 minutes midway through the second half they began to surge and swarm in familiar fashion At which point United abruptly buckled. Dele Alli had been quiet, but he was there to sweep in Christian Eriksen’s excellent cross from the left on 70 minutes. Three minutes later it was 2-0. Six minutes later it was 3-0, each goal coming from United’s right via a fairly simple cross. And suddenly United looked utterly hollowed out, bumbling, slope-shouldered, a group of players who simply no longer wanted to be there. At least at the start of the second half there was an opportunity to speculate exactly why, how, with what in mind – satire, boredom, an obscure absurdist protest at the rigidity of identity politics – Van Gaal would have decided to send on Ashley Young not as a false nine, or a deep-lying striker, but an actual lead-the-line centre forward. By the end Young had moved to right-back, Jesse Lingard had shuttled most of the way across the midfield, Juan Mata had spent an inconclusive spell filling in at right-wing, Fosu-Mensah had done a fine job winkled in at right-back. At the final whistle Van Gaal stood up as the players trooped off and ordered them down the touchline to applaud the away support. They looked more than a little surprised, but trudged over and waved a bit, to a mixed response. It was a fittingly half-cocked end to an afternoon on which the most jumbled, oddly skewed and seasick-looking United team of modern times more or less reached an end point in the Premier League season.\n",
      "£24k for an Adele ticket? But there could be a bargain in the next seat A rather apocalyptic report in the on Sunday noted how much one might pay to get tickets for Adele’s UK tour. It found that you could be charged up to £24,000 to see the superstar at the O2 in London, if you went through “secondary ticketing sites”. That was true. There were sellers asking those prices, but that doesn’t reflect the whole picture. Get Me In, the site that was – alas no longer; the listing has disappeared – offering four seats in row R of the top tier of the O2 for £22,000 each plus fees, also has tickets a couple of rows further forward for £180 each. It has tickets in block A3 – the seating block on the floor in front of the stage – for £2,750. That’s not meant to excuse those prices. They are horrific. The secondary ticket sites (where people resell tickets they have already bought, for events they can’t go to, often discovering they can’t go just seconds after buying the tickets, incredibly) have succeeded in turning touting into a leisure activity: lots of people now think nothing of buying an extra ticket or two and then offsetting the cost of their own attendance against the profit from tickets they resell. Worse still, secondary ticketing sites have become havens for organised touts, who’ve found ways around the flimsy security devices intended to deter them. What’s worse, plenty are engaging in what’s known as “speculative ticketing” – copying one of the less attractive practices of City trading by selling something they don’t have, in the hope that before the event comes, they’ll be able to buy the ticket they are advertising at a price less than they are selling for. If they can’t do that, of course, the secondary buyer never gets the ticket. It’s not really a surprise to learn that the Association of Chief Police Officers believes organised crime gangs are active in the secondary ticketing market, given the ease with which it’s possible to make a fortune. The government has also launched a review of the secondary ticketing market. Ticketmaster – which owns Get Me In and Seatwave – offered this defence: “Ticketing marketplaces react to demand and the willingness of fans to pay. With high-profile events, such as Adele, tickets are sometimes listed at prices higher than the face value. Tickets very rarely sell at these elevated prices though, with many selling at face value or below the original price.” What that means is that tickets for sold-out shows will go for more than face price, while tickets for shows that don’t sell out might go for less than face price. That doesn’t mean you’ll be able to get the best seats in the house for half price, mind you – if all the premium seats are gone, you’ll still have to pay through the nose. But if there are plenty of rubbish seats left at the box office, you might get them cheaply through a secondary seller. But the point about secondary ticket prices responding to demand is absolutely correct. The people who are charging a fortune for terrible tickets, having set the prices themselves, are either a) trolls b) misreading the markets or c) not expecting anyone to buy the tickets until the very last minute, when all other options have disappeared, and the only way someone with a great deal of money can get to see the show is if they are willing to be taken to the cleaners. It is routinely the case that when you see a ticket being sold for a truly eye-watering price, one that stretches credulity, then you will find a seat of similar quality for very much cheaper. It doesn’t make it right – I find the secondary ticketing business reprehensible, which is why I’ve always refused to do PR-driven interviews with the big players at any of the companies (they are offered frequently; these people are well aware of how bad they look when a story like the Adele tickets breaks) – but it’s important to remember that the headline price you might see offered isn’t the definitive price, it’s one price. How the big summer show prices compare on the big resale sites Beyoncé The cheapest seat we found for any of Beyoncé’s UK dates on Viagogo was £75.90, to sit in row 19 of block 519 at Wembley Stadium on 3 July – on the top tier, in the furthest corner from the stage. That’s to sit in a seat from which Beyoncé will be little more than a rumour. The most expensive was £12,101, for row 7 of block 520 on 2 July – another terrible seat, and the worst value we found. Leaving that one aside, it was a £10,000 drop to the next most expensive seats: £2,300 for block 206 was still awful value, given that while lower down, it’s still a long way from the stage, especially when £2,250 would buy you a “Beyhive” package with a standing place at the very front of the stage. Seatwave was much the same, with a cheapest ticket of £80 for block 516 of Wembley on 3 July, and a priciest one of £1,500 for Old Trafford cricket ground on 5 July, in its “The Point” section. Though that looks badly overpriced when you can still buy the top hospitality package for The Point for £375 for that show. Give it a couple of months. It’s the same story at the cheap end for Get Me In (£75.99 for block 526 at Wembley on 3 July), while its most expensive is an optimistic £5,500 to stand in the golden circle at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light on 28 June. You can get the same ticket, for the same show, on the same site, for £550. Stubhub has Wembley top tier seats for £75, with a Beyhive package topping the price list at £2,250 – how interesting that it’s the same price as on Viagogo. There’s also a general admission standing ticket for £2,500. That’s to stand miles away from the stage with no golden circle or Beyhive privileges. Coldplay Things are much the same at the bottom end for Coldplay – all four of the big resellers have their cheapest offers for seats in Wembley’s top tier, and all for the band’s show on 15 June (one of four Wembley gigs they are playing), with prices ranging from £70.91 (Viagogo) to £81.99 (Seatwave and Stubhub). At the other end of the scale, for three of the sites, the most expensive tickets are for the band’s gig at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on 4 June. Viagogo is offering a “VIP pass” for block 204 – second tier, decent position relative to the stage – for £900. The same block with no pass is £1,023.75 on Seatwave, and £1,320 on Get Me In. The most most expensive Stubhub seat for Wembley is £1,300 for block 227 of the Club Wembley tier – a decent seat, but not £1,300 worth of decent seat.\n",
      "How West Ham United are laying the foundations for long-term success Four years after promotion from the Championship, West Ham United, who take on Arsenal in the early kick-off on Saturday, are challenging for Champions League qualification under an exciting manager and on Wednesday face Manchester United for a place in the FA Cup semi‑finals. As West Ham prepare to move to the Olympic Stadium, people are asking whether this season is a flash in the pan or if they are capable of establishing themselves as title contenders. What are the key factors determining current success and future prospects? 1 The manager It always was a marriage of convenience between West Ham and Sam Allardyce and no one was getting anything out of it in the end. Supporters pined for a manager with a more expansive approach, someone who got their desire for attractive football and Slaven Bilic ticked that box. As a former player, he understood the West Ham way. At the same time, the club knew that replacing the pragmatic Allardyce with someone who had not managed in the Premier League was a risk, despite Bilic’s experiences with Croatia, Besiktas and Lokomotiv Moscow, and a shambolic 4-3 defeat at home to Bournemouth in August generated a sense of foreboding around Upton Park. Those fears quickly proved unfounded, though, as Bilic demonstrated he is a quick learner, reacting to the Bournemouth game by masterminding a 3-0 victory at Anfield, West Ham’s first win there since 1963. The holder of a law degree, he is a highly intelligent man and those close to him speak of a manager whose charisma, charm and passion allow him to command the respect and admiration of his squad. The players have embraced his methods. They are free to express themselves on the pitch and those who have been around for a long time cannot remember training being this intense. A day off early in the week is followed by sharp sessions as match day approaches and Bilic is a prominent figure on the training ground, allowing his assistants, Nikola Jurcevic and the popular Edin Terzic, to run the sessions while occasionally stepping in to offer a quiet word of advice here and there. West Ham are not flawless. They have struggled to assert themselves in several games, often starting slowly against lesser sides, and have ridden their luck at times. It makes their overall level hard to assess. Which is the real West Ham? The one that took 30 minutes to string two passes together against Norwich in September? Or the one that outplayed Tottenham Hotspur last month? Either way, they know how to stay in games. Take the 2-1 victory over Southampton on 28 December, when they were fortunate to be only 1-0 down at half-time, before Bilic’s substitutions changed the game. He can make tactical tweaks on the go and he is not afraid to ditch Plan A, which is why West Ham have recovered 12 points from losing positions this season. Bilic is capable of surprising his rivals, with the win over Spurs notable for his use of a 5-3-2 formation after months of veering between 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1, and his calm demeanour behind the scenes has helped the team maintain their composure when they are behind. Survival was the main objective at the start of the season but it was not long before West Ham were setting their targets higher. 2 The board As one board member puts it, 20 minutes in Bilic’s company is all it takes for people to warm to him and David Sullivan and David Gold, the club’s co-owners, knew that they had their man at the end of the interview with the Croat. There is chemistry, trust, a sense that the owners and the manager are pulling in the same direction. Sullivan and Gold have not got everything right since buying the club just over six years ago. Hiring Avram Grant in 2011 was a huge mistake. West Ham went down and needed Allardyce to piece them back together. Yet Sullivan and Gold are experienced and the good has outweighed the bad. Reeling under Icelandic ownership in 2010, West Ham were on the brink of financial oblivion. The squad was a mess and Mark Noble has admitted that the club was run like a circus. Now they are challenging for the Champions League qualification and will move into the Olympic Stadium this summer. The challenge is to keep growing. West Ham have had successful seasons in the past but the problem has been backing it up consistently. Previous regimes have stood still, leaving supporters cold with faceless PR. Sullivan and Gold are not everyone’s cup of tea but they have engaged with fans via traditional and social media and while West Ham cannot compete with the financial muscle of the traditional big clubs they are starting to challenge. 3 Recruitment Without spending eye-watering sums, West Ham have been astute in the transfer market in the past two years. Sullivan is heavily involved in identifying and securing targets, while Tony Henry, who worked with David Moyes at Everton, has performed excellently since being put in charge of the recruitment department. Diafra Sakho, signed for £3.75m, was playing in the French second division. Cheikhou Kouyaté joined from the Belgian champions, Anderlecht, for £5.63m. Angelo Ogbonna arrived for £8.25m from Juventus, the £4.5m midfielder Pedro Obiang has impressed since joining from Sampdoria and even Dimitri Payet, signed for £11.25m from Marseille, was overlooked by other clubs. It has reached the point where even the groundsmen cannot tear their eyes away when Payet practises his free-kicks in training and sighs of disappointment can be heard around Chadwell Heath when the ball flies off target. West Ham believe that the 29-year-old is worth every penny of his £125,000-a-week, five-year deal. That was a sign of West Ham’s intent and perhaps they will look to make one marquee signing this summer; they have targeted two expensive forwards, for instance, Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette and Marseille’s Michy Batshuayi. Yet they have not been afraid to sign players from the Championship. Aaron Cresswell cost £3.5m from Ipswich Town, Sam Byram cost £3.7m from Leeds United and Michail Antonio cost £7m from Nottingham Forest. Antonio, 26, has scored seven goals despite breaking into the team only in December. Loan deals have also given West Ham time to think. While they signed Manuel Lanzini on a permanent basis last month, waiting before spending £9m on a 22-year-old Argentinian who had been playing in the Middle East, Emmanuel Emenike, Victor Moses and Alex Song will probably be sent back to their parent clubs. 4 Squad depth Bilic has selection headaches now that he has a fully fit squad and, although West Ham’s FA Cup quarter-final replay against United is a few days away, he will play his strongest side when Arsenal visit Upton Park on Saturday afternoon. But for the injury crisis that decimated West Ham’s attack in the winter months, they might have challenged for the title. Yet Bilic looks back on that period positively. The squad players stepped up and West Ham had to graft during a nine-game unbeaten run. Bilic did not hide his frustration about the spate of muscle injuries that threatened to derail his side, prompting the former West Ham winger Matthew Etherington to criticise the quality of the pitches at Chadwell Heath. There is respect for the experienced fitness coach, Miljenko Rak, and West Ham hope that moving to their new site in Rush Green will solve the problem. 5 The stadium Arsenal are generating more match‑day revenue than any club in the world, making over £100m from the Emirates Stadium last year. Manchester United made £87.96m from Old Trafford, Chelsea made £71.84m from Stamford Bridge. Liverpool made £57.85m from Anfield and Tottenham made £41.83m from White Hart Lane. West Ham made £19.9m from Upton Park, which holds 35,000. Although the majority of income for Premier League clubs comes from the broadcast money, moving to a bigger, commercially attractive stadium will strengthen West Ham’s position. Far from struggling to fill the Olympic Stadium, West Ham are expanding the capacity from 54,000 to 60,000 and could eventually increase it to 66,000. The attraction is clear. Upton Park can be difficult to reach and even harder to get away from after full time. Getting to Stratford is simple. The team are playing well. There are whispers of a visit from Barcelona in pre-season. Champions League football is a possibility. What West Ham can hope to make from the stadium remains unclear, with critics of the move pushing the London Legacy Development Committee to release the full terms of a deal that has led to disputes over the use of public funds and the cost to taxpayers, but it has boosted their commercial potential. Last year they agreed a record shirt sponsorship deal with the online bookmakers Betway, who agreed to pay £20m over three and a half years. “When the deal was signed with West Ham United we were in the right place at the right time, but there was certainly a long term view towards the Olympic Stadium and the growth of the club because of that move,” a spokesman for Betway told the . The challenge for West Ham is to keep their identity after the move. Upton Park remains one of the most atmospheric grounds in the country and, while the club are pulling out all the stops to make the Olympic Stadium feel like home, the adjustment will not be straightforward. Ambition must not come at the cost of the club’s soul.\n",
      "Ashley Williams sinks Watford to lift Swansea out of relegation zone In many ways this felt like another of those days when it was hard to make sense of the storyline that is unfolding at Swansea City this season, yet at least on this occasion there was a happy ending for the Welsh club. Ashley Williams chose a good time to score his first Premier League goal at the Liberty Stadium, the captain’s first-half header being enough to lift Swansea out of the relegation zone and to give Francesco Guidolin, who was watching from the stands, something to build on. Guidolin, who has been named as the new head coach in the latest bizarre development at Swansea, was looking down from the directors’ box on a night when Alan Curtis took charge of his last game before preparing to take a step backwards. It was not exactly comfortable viewing for Guidolin and at one stage near the end, after Neil Taylor’s careless header gave José Manuel Jurado a chance to equalise, the Italian could be seen running a hand over his face in despair. Swansea, however, held on and the raucous celebrations that greeted the final whistle provided evidence of how significant this victory was regarded for a club that had won only two of its previous 17 league matches and, in terms of results, has been playing relegation football since September. Curtis had initially been charged with the task of reviving the club and it is hard to escape the feeling that there is something very odd about the way that Swansea have handled things since, even if the Welshman sounded relaxed about the chain of events that has effectively seen him replaced only 11 days after he was told he had the job until the end of the season. “I’ve always been quite happy if the club thought it was necessary to bring somebody in,” Curtis said, reflecting on Guidolin’s appointment. “It sounds an obvious thing but I think if we had won more games, then possibly there might not have been a need. I think our performances have been good and we haven’t had the results those performances warranted. You’re bringing in an experienced coach and manager and maybe he can get points out of those good performances. Again, I haven’t really got a problem with that.” Gabriele Ambrosetti has joined the coaching staff and the impression that Curtis gave is that the former Chelsea midfielder will be used as an interpreter as much as a coach. What is clear, however, is that Guidolin, who led Udinese to third place in Serie A and has a colourful CV with a vast amount of coaching experience over several decades, will pick the team and take the lead in the training. “You can’t have a joint managership. It’s got to be one or the other. I’m quite happy for Francesco to have that,” Curtis said. With eight points from his seven games in charge since Garry Monk’s sacking last month, Curtis may privately reflect that he was a little unfortunate to be asked to hand over the reins so soon. At least he has the satisfaction of doing so on the back of a win and with Swansea above that dreaded drop zone. Swansea did enough to pick up three points here but it was not a hugely convincing performance and Watford, who slumped to a fourth straight league defeat, proved to be obliging opponents. Quique Sánchez Flores’s side were particularly flat in the first half, which the Watford manager attributed to a hangover from their disappointing display at Southampton last Wednesday, and, although there was an improvement after the restart, the visitors never did enough to expose Swansea’s weaknesses. Miguel Britos headed Ben Watson’s deep free-kick on to the roof of the net and Jurado, who offered a sporadic threat drifting in from the left, had that late chance but otherwise Watford struggled to create much. “We are not happy with the first half,” said Flores, who will hope that the arrival of Nordin Amrabat from Málaga in a club-record £6.7m deal will give the team a lift. “But we have enough points to be positive.” Williams’ goal was something of a collector’s item and provided a rare moment of excitement in a drab first half. Wayne Routledge, one of the smallest players on the pitch, won an important header on the edge of the area and Williams was able to hook the ball on to Ki Sung-yueng. Afforded the time and space to pick out his man, Ki delivered a measured centre from close to the byline that Williams headed emphatically beyond Heurelho Gomes. Swansea looked anxious in the second half although Bafétimbi Gomis did thump the upright late on. “It was a massive win, takes us out of the bottom three and psychologically that will give us a lift,” Curtis said. “I think over the course of the 90 minutes we deserved it. We got a little bit edgy in the second half, that’s probably more down to the situation we find ourselves in. Certainly I think if we had got that second goal we would have relaxed but I suppose that’s going to be the way between now and the end of the season.”\n",
      "400 Days review – like Solaris performed by sock puppets This low-budget sci-fi thriller starts out semi-promisingly and then runs out of steam, ideas and, seemingly, interest from the film-makers in getting the job done, given its fizzle of an ending. Four would-be astronauts – Brandon Routh, Dane Cook, Caity Lotz and Ben Feldman – sign up for a private-sector-funded experiment, a sort of hi-tech dress rehearsal, in a fake space ship buried underground to simulate the conditions of deep-space travel. They are warned that there may be surprises in store to test how they handle emergencies. But when the air supply is damaged, is the quartet’s paranoia the result of oxygen deprivation or justified anxiety about who is controlling the experiment and what’s going on? The first third generates a modicum of drama out of interpersonal tensions, especially given the revelation that Routh and Lotz used to be a couple. But nearly all the spooky bits are achieved by pure aural assault, and the characters are such stock types, haunted by such predictable backstories, it’s like watching Solaris performed by sock puppets.\n",
      "Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend 1) Start of a tough run for the Hammers On the last day of the 2006-07 season Manchester United, who had won the title five days earlier, fielded a weakened side – Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were all left out of the starting XI – at Old Trafford against a West Ham team who needed at least a point to avoid relegation. Carlos Tevez, who was to join United a few weeks later, scored the only goal on the stroke of half-time. “They couldn’t have come to Old Trafford on a better day,” said Sir Alex Ferguson after the game. “We had already won the league and the edge was off our game.” There was also a 1-0 win in December 2001, against a wretchedly out-of-form United side that were completing a memorably horrific run of five defeats in seven league games. Those two games are the Hammers’ only highlights in a miserable run of top-flight visits to Old Trafford that now extends over 30 years and in which they have otherwise drawn once and lost 20 times. And now they must go there twice in four days, with Sunday’s match being followed by an EFL Cup quarter-final on Wednesday (in the same time period they have visited Old Trafford four times in cup competitions, losing two and winning one). With the Manchester double-header to be followed by games against Arsenal and Liverpool, stories this week suggesting “West Ham chiefs have started to consider their options should they feel forced to make a change” are not just unwelcome but almost cruel. After the visit to Anfield the Hammers have a less daunting run of four fixtures before the turn of the year and it would seem sensible to delay any judgment until they have been completed, which will helpfully coincide with the start of a new transfer window and, less helpfully, another game against Manchester United. SB • Are Manchester United really the unluckiest team in the Premier League? 2) Karanka’s bewildering persistence with Negredo Álvaro Negredo has failed to score for Middlesbrough since forcing home a close range debut goal with his shoulder against Stoke City on the opening day of the season and there is a growing clamour on Teesside for Aitor Karanka to drop the on-loan Valencia striker from a team that is joint bottom of the Premier League goalscoring charts alongside Hull with just 10. Karanka, whose side face Leicester City on Saturday, recently came out in defence of his compatriot, who has failed to find the net in 11 consecutive matches and looked woeful against Chelsea, where his obvious lack of speed and mobility came in for criticism. “He is working and fighting but he is not playing at Chelsea or Manchester City,” said Karanka, before expanding on a theme that is unlikely to boost dressing-room morale at the Riverside. “He is not with the team-mates he had in the past or the team-mates Diego Costa had at Chelsea.” Negredo has played 85 minutes or more in 10 of the 12 matches he has featured in for Boro this season and on the only occasion he was substituted – replaced by Jordan Rhodes against Tottenham Hotspur – Karanka’s switch was greeted with loud applause from the Riverside faithful. Middlesbrough’s manager may still have faith in his striker, but the fans do not. Rhodes and his fellow striker David Nugent have yet to complete a game in eight Premier League appearances between them this season and surely can’t do any worse than the man who has restricted them to little more than fleeting cameos off the bench. BG • Leicester City top dogs after Shinji Okazaki leads win over Club Brugge • Ranieri delighted but desperate to focus on Premier League problems • Danny Drinkwater to serve three-match ban for violent conduct 3) Cherries struggle against top five Bournemouth have impressed all impartial observers since their promotion in 2015, and indeed for a while before that, but their results against the current Premier League top five have disappointed: in 12 games so far they have won one – against Chelsea shortly before José Mourinho’s sacking last December – lost 10 and sit on the wrong end of an aggregate score of 31-5 (every other team that was in the division last season has been beaten at least once except Watford and Leicester, against whom they have neither won nor lost). Arsenal won both of their meetings last season by the same score, 2-0, and will face a Bournemouth side forced to play without the influential and injury-free midfielder Jack Wilshere, on loan from Arsenal. Despite his absence it might be a tough day for the woodwork, with these teams being the two most post-rattling in the top flight: the Cherries lead the way in this regard, having struck the frame of the goal 13 times so far, and Arsenal follow behind with eight.

Between them, Crystal Palace and Swansea City have managed just four wins and a staggering 15 defeats in 24 Premier League matches so far this season, a state of affairs that makes this contest the weekend’s equivalent of two drunks swinging at each other in an alley. Should either manager lose a game likely to be low on finesse but no less compelling a spectacle for its absence, they will find themselves the subject of no end of criticism from fans for whom the spectre of relegation looms increasingly large. Alan Pardew seems genuinely delusional, having convinced himself his side do not concede from set-pieces even though the stats suggest otherwise. Nine of the 21 goals shipped by Palace this season have come from dead ball situations and in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea have one of the most accurate set-piece specialists in the business. Whether it’s from one or more of the free-kicks and corners Pardew’s team have proved so hopelessly inept at defending, the in-form Icelandic midfielder could well prove instrumental in helping Bob Bradley secure his maiden victory as Swansea City manager in a game that looks must-win for both men in charge. BG • The Knowledge: players confused by penalty rebounds 5) Ighalo’s woes to continue There has only been one home win in the last eight matches between Watford and Stoke, the away side winning five of those games including both of last season’s encounters. But Stoke have only won one away game since their visit to Vicarage Road in March – at Hull last month – and will probably have to overcome a Watford side buoyed not only by last week’s victory over Leicester but by the new formation that brought it. When preparing for his last visit to Hertfordshire Mark Hughes spoke about the Hornets’ key threat at the time, their front two of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney. “The two guys up top have had a big influence on what they’ve done,” he said. “They are a good pairing who work off each other really well and certainly they are something we’ll talk about before the game.” This time he needn’t bother: Ighalo’s influence in recent months has been minimal, leading to him being dropped in favour of Isaac Success for last month’s victory at Middlesbrough. Injuries to both Success and Watford’s other first-team striker, Stefano Okaka, allowed Ighalo to return to the side for their following three games but last week he was on the bench again as Walter Mazzarri played a 5-4-1 formation in which Troy Deeney was given considerably more effective support by a combination of the two wide midfielders, Roberto Pereyra and Nordin Amrabat, and by Etienne Capoue’s running from central midfield. When Deeney was replaced late in the game, it was by the recently-recovered Okaka; with Success now ready to return to the squad, Ighalo’s hopes of a return to the starting XI appear, like his recent form, underwhelming. SB • Football Weekly Extra: AC Jimbo and co preview the weekend 6) A third consecutive win for Sunderland? Free-scoring Sunderland have never beaten Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League era but will fancy their slim chances of bucking that trend as they arrive on the back of consecutive wins for the first time since last May. Sunderland last won three consecutive league games three seasons and three managers ago, on the run-in of the 2013-14 campaign when wins over Chelsea, Cardiff City, Manchester United and then West Brom helped them pull off the mother of all escape acts. The bookies give them little or no chance of beating Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, who drew a rare blank against Southampton last weekend and have had a full week to find their range. You can get odds of 16-1 against David Moyes’s side making it three wins on the spin, but with confidence high, Moyes having bought himself some much-needed wriggle room and Victor Anichebe joining Jermain Defoe among the goals, Sunderland could conceivably leave Anfield with a point or even more. Of course the far more likely scenario is that they will get thumped but in facing top class opposition will at least get to see if their two recent victories were more down to good luck (Bournemouth) and the poor quality of their opposition (Hull City) than any major advances they have made under the stewardship of Moyes. BG • Steven Gerrard retires from football after ‘incredible career’ • Paul Wilson: Charlton and Guardiola offer Gerrard lessons from history • Sean Ingle: Do stats support ‘benefits’ of Liverpool’s European absence? 7) Burnley have a chance of an upset Manchester City’s last two Champions League games were followed by disappointing 1-1 draws at home to Southampton and Middlesbrough, and now they must follow a similar result at Borussia Mönchengladbach with a visit to a side that has already beaten Liverpool and Everton (as well as Watford and Crystal Palace) and come within a whisker of holding Arsenal, all at home. Burnley are the division’s Jekyll and Hyde side, boasting the sixth-best home record with an average 1.86 points per game (having played once more at home than any other team) and the second-worst away record, with the goalless draw at Old Trafford last month securing the only point they have won in five games on their travels. Motivated by the rollicking Sean Dyche gave them following a 4-0 capitulation at West Bromwich Albion on Monday – he told the press they “got drunk on the ball” and “just looked weak willed” – and against opponents who are themselves out of form and against whom they have a decent recent record (amounting to two draws and a win each in four Premier League encounters, though Burnley’s victory was a tight 1-0 win in March 2015, and City’s a 6-1 thumping in April 2010), there is reason for genuine optimism. Dyche said his side are relying on little more than “the marvel of football” and the fact “random results turn up”, but he is perhaps understating the chances of an upset.

Along with several extremely courageous former footballers, the ’s chief football correspondent, Daniel Taylor, continues to shine a light on the hitherto unreported scandal of historical cases of child abuse of footballers in a depressing story that looks likely to run and run. Considering some of those victims who have come forward to tell their horrific stories previously felt unable to speak out for fear of being labelled “gay”, any campaign to support LGBT people and stamp out homophobic abuse in football can only be applauded. BG 9) Some resilience from Spurs Ten minutes. That’s how long Chelsea need to keep Tottenham Hotspur at bay this weekend to rack up 600 Premier League minutes without conceding a goal. Should they beat Spurs and hold them scoreless, Antonio Conte’s men will have recorded seven consecutive league wins without conceding a goal, two shy of the record set by Stockport County, then of League Two, between 13 January and 2 March 2007. It will be intriguing to see how Spurs bounce back from the midweek disappointment of their defeat at the hands of Monaco, in which there were several conspicuous absentees from Mauricio Pochettino’s starting lineup and few of those the manager did select covered themselves in glory. After their midweek meltdown, Tottenham could hope for no stiffer test than a run-out against the Premier League leaders with their apparently impregnable defence and an attack that is behind only Liverpool in terms of goals scored. With Pochettino having questioned the mental fortitude of his players during the week, the manner in which Spurs bounce back from Wednesday’s Champions League reverse ought to give a fair indication of whether their season will end with a half-decent title challenge or merely end up petering out and finishing up in an underwhelming and characteristically Spursy fashion.

After his move was announced the former Southampton goalkeeper Artur Boruc tweeted something Koeman had said a couple of moths previously, criticising “the lack of loyalty in modern day football” and asserting not only that would not be tempted away from the St Mary’s Stadium for “short-term gains”, but he “would hate to ever become that kind of manager”. As he walks out before the game he may become the latest manager to be reminded that it is not so much the leaving of a club by which they will be judged, but the manner of it.

      "Individual athletes more prone to depression, researchers find Athletes in individual sports are more prone to depression than those in team games, according to German research to be presented at a conference in Cardiff. The research by the Technical University of Munich confirms not just the loneliness of the long distance runner but a range of other depressive symptoms among solo sportsmen and women more generally. Prof Jürgen Beckmann, the university’s chair of sports psychology who will be presenting the research, said: “Individual athletes attribute failure more to themselves than team sports athletes. They take the blame more than team players. On a team there is a diffusion of responsibility, as social physiologists would say, compared with the performance of an individual athlete.” One of the studies compared 128 young German footballers and hockey players with 71 junior athletes in a range of individual sports including swimming, speed skating and badminton. They were assessed on a depression scale that measures symptoms such as guilt, sadness and suicidal feelings. It found that individual athletes showed significantly more signs of such symptoms than athletes in team sports. The finding was replicated in a study of 162 senior elite athletes including many in various German national teams. Individual athletes including triathletes, golfers and cyclists were found to have higher symptoms of depression than team players in games that included volleyball, rugby and football. The research, which is to be presented at the British Psychological Society annual sport and exercise conference in Cardiff on Monday, found that the individual athletes tend to blame themselves for sporting failure. One of the papers to be presented suggests that individual athletes take both sporting success and failure more personally than team players. “The internal attribution could lead to stronger experiences of emotions such as pride (positive events) and guilt or shame (negative events) in athletes in individual sports,” one of the papers says. The researchers also expected to find more signs of perfectionism among individual athletes but were surprised to discover that team players were more prone to perfectionism. A separate long-term study found that perfectionism and chronic stress often led to burnout but not depression. Depression was found to be linked with a lack of time to recover from stress and injury. The research also found that depressive symptoms were particularly prevalent among young athletes. Beckmann said: “The real problem is with young athletes. Those who receive social support from parents and peers experience much less stress than those who don’t. That’s especially important during adolescence. “We found that up to 20% of young athletes do have a problem with higher depression scores. In the general population its range is between 9% and 12%. “We are not diagnosing them as being depressive, but on the depression scales they have quite a score.” He said subsequent studies have suggested that the level could be even higher among solo athletes only. “We have very high prevalence rates in swimming, for example,” Beckmann said. He called for more support to be given to athletes to help them recognise signs of depression and to suggest ways of tackling it. He said: “In Germany, we have developed a burnout and screening instrument for junior athletes and a website to give them advice on coping with stress and other psychological problems they may experience.” The mental health charity Mind said the research underlined pressures facing athletes. Hayley Jarvis, Mind’s community programmes manager for sport, said: “Following the increasing number of ex-sportspeople who have spoken out about struggles with their own mental health and some high profile suicides, Mind commissioned research to explore how sports’ governing bodies and players’ organisations currently deal with mental health, and identify best practice which can be shared with other sports. “To help create an environment where all sports professionals can fulfil their potential, we need to see managers, coaches, clubs, governing bodies and players’ unions all support athletes to manage their mental wellbeing.” Andy Baddeley’s story Andy Baddeley, a two-time Olympian and Britain’s former No 1 1,500m runner, has blogged about his experiences of depression on the Mind website. Speaking to the , he said: The hardest thing about running is that you are on own before a race. When things are great that’s what’s good about it. I’m not dependent on 10 other guys being on the top of their game in order for me to be successful. But there is also nothing to fall back on. The nature of athletics is that one guy gets to win each race, and so there’s 11 or more in my event who don’t. And its that unpredictability that’s the hard bit. It got to a point with my coach when I couldn’t express how low I was. There are not many people I get to talk to about these things. I’m not surrounded by a team. I don’t have to turn up to a training ground. I have often felt that I would be better suited to a team sport. What I enjoy most is group training, but the nature of distance running is that that doesn’t happen every day. You’re the only one who can train hard. It is a lonely decision each day, especially when it’s cold and raining. If I plan to meet someone, I find that’s powerful in terms of motivation. And it’s the days when I am not meeting someone that it takes me a lot longer than it should to get myself out of the door. Talking to someone is what has helped me. My mental health has been best when I’ve been meeting coaches and other team members. Having a mental heath struggle doesn’t mean you are not mentally strong for a race. These things are separate. You can still run through the pain barrier but still have bad days – they are not mutually exclusive. People think admitting mental health problems makes them seem weak or susceptible to being beaten. But after I wrote about my experiences I felt stronger. I was lucky enough to see a sports psychologist when I was on lottery funding. When I was injured I saw someone privately and that helped. I deliberately chose a non-sports psychologist because I wanted more of an idea of what was normal, rather than what’s normal in elite sport.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

      "Manchester United’s Henrikh Mkhitaryan takes breath away with sublime moment Life is sustained not just by what it is but by what it might be; if we weren’t continually hoping for better, how could we carry on? And the tease works just as well when watching sport, a generally disappointing activity that costs time, money, energy and patience. We keep coming back, though, mainly because that’s what we do, but also because it gives us a shot at seeing the most incredible earthly event on any given day. Your sunrises, your sunsets and your newborns are all very nice, but at its best, sport is the best, and yesterday that meant your Henrikh Mkhitaryans. A particular joy of football is the infinite number of ways there are to get the spherical thing into the rectangular thing. Even so, most brilliant goals are riffs on eternal themes, but every so often we get a Roberto Carlos against France or a Ronaldinho against Chelsea , recalibrating reality to remind us that we haven’t seen it all. And it reflects not just skill but character. After joining Manchester United in the summer, Mkhitaryan began the season as a substitute, a move which seemed to reflect little more than United’s comparative strength in wide attackers – and away to Hull City, he still catalysed an onslaught that brought an injury-time winner. Next came the Manchester derby, a match which Mkhitaryan started though he’d picked up a knock playing for Armenia while, on the opposite wing, Jesse Lingard, returned after a month out. Remarkably, both were off the pace, subbed and criticised afterwards; curiously, José Mourinho was less loquacious in explaining how either were meant to get the ball given the midfield mismatch that was Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba against Fernandinho, Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva as City won the match 2-1. But the blame was set. Lingard vanished for two weeks and Mkhitaryan for two months, deemed ill-prepared for the harum-scarum of the English game. This is not unusual, there was just little reason to expect it in this instance. Mkhitaryan grew up in Armenia, played for two teams in Donetsk, and then moved to Borussia Dortmund; we can probably assume that he has a solid grasp of cold, rain and grime. Moreover, he arrived at the top of his game and in his physical prime, which made Hull look a more telling cameo than City. While he acclimatised, United floundered, dominating some games, disappearing in others, and struggling to score in nearly all of them. Apparently, a man directly involved in 49 goals the previous season had nothing to offer against Stoke City and Burnley, omitted in favour of Memphis Depay. Or, put another way, Mourinho’s policy of antidisestablishmkhitaryanism didn’t sit right, reminiscent of earlier problems with Arjen Robben, De Bruyne and Eden Hazard. Then, at the start of November, Mkhitaryan appeared off the bench away to Fenerbahce, but despite the uniform awfulness of United’s performance, he was left out of the next two games, by which time he had played just 134 minutes of a possible 1,710. For a man who arrived as the Bundesliga player of the year, the frustration of peak months wasted cannot have been easy to take. Eventually, though, Mourinho was convinced – coincidentally, at a time when he had run out of alternatives and was desperate for a win. So Mkhitaryan started at home to Feyenoord and was superb; it was almost as though he could have made a difference all along, not that Mourinho had calculated precisely the right moment to unleash him. Still, he was left on the bench for United’s home Premier League draw with West Ham, returning to the starting XI for the EFL Cup tie against the same opposition. It took him all of two minutes to backheel Zlatan Ibrahimovic through for the opening goal in a 4-1 victory, and then, after a patchy but largely impressive display against Everton, he saw off Zorya in the Europa League and Tottenham with a pair of dazzling finishes, before getting injured again. Returning against Sunderland, Mkhitaryan was introduced after an hour and almost immediately, broke with the ball in the inside-right position. Allowing it across his body as he moved towards goal, at the very last second and when it no longer looked possible, suddenly it was gliding back the other way to put Ibrahimovic in; this time, he missed. The pass, though, with its delay and disguise, encapsulated Mkhitaryan. So it was that with four minutes to go, Ibrahimovic pulled on to the right wing and Mkhitaryan bustled into the middle. Uncharacteristically, he was ahead of the play as the cross came in – “offside”, some have said – but before the ball arrived, he somehow decided what to do, adjusted his feet, inclined his body and dived forwards as it passed behind him, flinging a leg over his back to place a finish into the far corner with the outside of his right heel! It is hard enough to describe, never mind execute. In England, the moment of celebration is different to elsewhere, the squeak of “Yes!” not as primal, guttural and full as the roar of “Gol!” But presented with something it had never seen before, Old Trafford produced something closer to the latter, a collective “Ohhhhh!” of belief and disbelief, of ecstasy and community. It was the sound of a better life.\n",
      "Randy Lerner’s Aston Villa head for relegation woefully unprepared It’s brutal, relegation. If you follow a team the chances are you have suffered it at some point or another and, as Aston Villa’s supporters can probably testify, it does not matter how prepared you think you might be, or how many times it might have happened in the past, it is still a desperately numbing feeling when the guillotine falls and the players are wandering around, like zombies, not knowing where to rest their eyes. “I’ve seen childbirth twice and relegation five times,” Pete May, the author of several books on West Ham, once wrote. “Childbirth does look very painful but it lasts only a few hours. The pain of relegation lasts all summer and beyond. Plus childbirth at least results in something positive. With relegation, you’re always worried that it’s going to get worse.” It often does, as Leicester City can corroborate bearing in mind the previous ordeals encountered by the champions-in-waiting and what those experiences tell Villa about the potential for more unravelling. Leicester’s last demotion from the Premier League, in 2004, was followed by successive finishes of 15th, 16th and 19th in the Championship and then another deterioration in their fourth season at that level – to 22nd and a place in League One. Nottingham Forest have spent time in the third best division in English football or, put another way, the second worst. Leeds United have been down there and David Bernstein, one of the executives Villa have hired to try to halt the downward spiral, will know the dangers from first-hand experience if we go back to his days as Manchester City chairman and an era of Richard Edghill, Ged Brannan and Lee Bradbury rather than Vincent Kompany, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero. City went two leagues down before coming back up and when the fingers of relegation closed around their neck for a second time the Manchester Evening News carried a photograph of a young supporter wiping away tears with a flag. Bernstein asked for a copy of that picture and hung it in the boardroom at Maine Road. It was a reminder, he used to tell guests, that the club must never put their fans through the same again. Bernstein also wrote to the club’s season-ticket holders to apologise – which is the least that Villa should be doing – while City, the official club magazine, attempted to lift the mood in an article entitled: “Reasons to be cheerful”. These included “fun weekends at a variety of coastal resorts like Blackpool and Bournemouth”, the prospect of “red-hot Lancashire derbies against grand old names like Burnley and Preston North End” and, best of all, the “chance to snuggle up together in the ‘cosy’ stands we’ll be visiting on our away trips”. Among them, Lincoln City, Macclesfield Town and York City. Villa are not quite that broken but, equally, it is difficult finding any reasons for them to be cheerful when Walsall and Burton Albion could conceivably be on their list of derbies next season and the stench of disillusionment, built up over six years of drift, listless performances and boardroom buffoonery, has become so overpowering it is difficult to imagine that fumigating the place will be a quick fix. The financial impact, even taking into account the parachute money from the Premier League, means losing upwards of £200m merely from television revenue if they cannot find a way back during the next three years. The new television deal comes into force in August and will be worth £8.3bn over that time. Then factor in the lost ticket revenue, sponsorship and other forms of income. However it is dressed up, there has never been a worse time for relegation. All of which leaves Villa in a harrowing position, bearing in mind the size and history of the place and the feeling I still get, 25 years after walking down Witton Lane for the first time, that the imposing red-brick walls, the steps leading to the Holte End, the statues of the lions, the colours and the noise make Villa Park one of football’s special monuments. The club have, if nothing else, recognised that it is not just the playing staff that has to be overhauled and begun the process by bringing in Bernstein as well as a new chairman, Steve Hollis, and creating new positions on the board for Brian Little, a former Villa player and manager, and Adrian Bevington, previously of the Football Association. That, at least, is a start and few will miss the former chief executive, Tom Fox, or the sporting director, Hendrik Almstadt, who has also been ushered off the premises. All the same, there is an awful lot of work to be done when, trying to make sense of the Randy Lerner era, there is a jarring irony that they have just lopped off the word “Prepared” from their expensively redesigned club crest (Villa having spent more on that badge and all the necessary changes than Lerner was apparently prepared to pay for any players in January to get them out of this hole). One long-serving employee was asked recently to undertake a quiz on Villa’s history to convince the people above her that she should keep her job. In total, there could be 100 job losses and it will be intriguing to see whether Paddy Riley, the former video analyst who now goes by the title of director of scouting and recruitment, is spared. Riley’s transfer record hardly eases the suspicion that he has been overpromoted and there is an excruciating story about what happened when the agent of one signing turned up to negotiate the contract. Riley had been put in charge along with the club secretary, Sharon Barnhurst, and the agent was so unimpressed by the absence of more senior staff he is said to have taken one look and walked out in a fit of pique. Riley did, in fairness, persuade him to return. Nigel Pearson is an obvious candidate for the manager’s job but there are no indications that Lerner is any closer to finding a buyer and, in the meantime, the bottom line is that Villa have become a tragicomedy, on and off the pitch. One of the club’s European scouts, with responsibility for Spain and Portugal, turns out to be a journalism student. Another is said to have emigrated to Australia earlier this season, at a time when his role was apparently to cover the Bundesliga. As for the players, what does it say for Gabriel Agbonlahor – born in Birmingham, affiliated to Villa since a young age and someone, you might assume, who would give everything for his club – that he is so bereft of professional decency he has just been placed on a two-week fitness programme because he cannot even keep himself in shape? Agbonlahor, with one goal all season, spent the last international break partying in Dubai. His attitude is symptomatic of the culture of drift and, if Villa have serious aspirations of restoring some dignity, this summer might be a good time to thank him for happier days and cut him loose. It is a tremendous mess and, plainly, it is easier for Lerner to avoid awkward questions about his culpability when the other option is to keep his distance, holed away in the Hamptons, and communicate in occasional statements via the club’s website. “I can’t think of anyone else in Cleveland sports in the last 30 years who rode into town with similar fanfare and delivered so little in comparison,” Bill Livingston, the American sportswriter, once wrote of Lerner’s time in charge of the Cleveland Browns, and Villa’s followers will note the similarities. “The biggest constant among those Randy hired was a lack of judgment,” Livingston concluded. “He wasn’t a good owner by any means, but he wasn’t a lucky one, either.” One day, maybe, the subject of all this criticism will be decent enough to answer the principal charge that he simply went cold on Villa, having been unable to break into the Champions League positions in his early years, and withdrew to a point that it became inevitable stagnation would follow. Not the most important thing right now, perhaps, but Lerner could also explain why Fox’s annual salary was almost five times higher than that of the previous chief executive, Paul Faulkner, up from £265,792 to £1,255,769. Maybe he could let us know whether it was really necessary to have 496 members of staff, the sixth highest in the league, compared with, say, Tottenham Hotspur (380), Newcastle United (288) and Everton (274), and more than the combined workforce of West Ham (250) and Leicester (188). And maybe, like Bernstein all those years ago, he might want to apologise to all those supporters who suspected this mismanagement and apathy would take them only one direction. Kevin doesn’t need friends like these The decision to remove Kevin Friend from refereeing duties for Tottenham Hotspur’s visit to Stoke City on Monday was always bewildering but especially now it transpires that he is apparently a Bristol City supporter. Friend lives in Leicester and, by his own admission, has been to watch Claudio Ranieri’s team this season, but taking him off a game because a few daft people think he will deliberately give decisions against Spurs sets a dangerous precedent, as Arsène Wenger has stated, and it all seems particularly unnecessary when the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has made it clear he had no issue whatsoever with the original choice of officials. Friend’s treatment comes across as a lack of trust from the organisation that employs him – even if, conversely, the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd will argue the decision was taken to protect him - and if it is true that it stemmed from a social‑media campaign from Spurs fans (one that certainly passed me by) should the decision-makers really be pandering to the Twitter orchestra? Sure enough, there are now Everton supporters questioning the appointment of Anthony Taylor for their team’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on the basis that he lives in Altrincham, just a few miles from Old Trafford. Already, it has been noted that Michael Oliver – a Newcastle supporter, apparently – refereed Norwich’s 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend and turned down a penalty appeal that might have led to the game being drawn and, in turn, ultimately benefited his own club. Nobody had given it a second thought until now but no doubt there will be fans of other clubs scouring referees’ profiles to come up with historic grievances or flimsy arguments why further restrictions should be placed. A different case could be highlighted every week and the referees are probably entitled to wonder why their organisation has given credence to a fuss about nothing. PFA awards fail to tell whole story The Professional Footballers’ Association holds its player of the year awards next weekend and it would be a surprise, looking back at the last eight months, if the prize went to anyone bar one of the three Leicester City players – Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kanté – on the six‑man shortlist. What, though, if Leicester suddenly implode from this point onwards and Harry Kane’s goals take Tottenham Hotspur to the title? Who would ultimately be the more deserving player? It is certainly strange that the PFA holds this event a month before the season has finished and even more so that the voting slips had an 8 April deadline but actually started coming back at the beginning of March, when some teams still had 10 games to play. In 2016, is it really beyond Gordon Taylor and his colleagues to hold the event at the end of the season and find an online voting system that means the award is for the full campaign?\n",
      "Louis van Gaal blames Manchester United players for Newcastle draw It was a case of one step forward and two steps back for Manchester United and Louis van Gaal as they cast off their recent “boring” image on Tyneside on Tuesday night but, despite some thrilling attacking, dropped to sixth place in the Premier League. “Of course it feels like a defeat … we are very disappointed, we’ve lost very expensive points,” he said after his side’s 3-3 draw at Newcastle United where, despite Wayne Rooney scoring twice and creating another goal for Jesse Lingard, the visitors could not hold on to their leads. “We have only ourselves to blame because we could have won this match,” said Manchester United’s manager. “We missed big chances to win it. We were the better team. We have scored three goals but only have one point. So now is the defence weak? No. We were unlucky in decisions of the referee and a deflected shot and we did not finish our chances.” The Dutchman was unhappy with the award of a penalty to Newcastle, for shirt-pulling by Chris Smalling on Aleksandar Mitrovic, that made it 2-2, but put the blame on his own players. “We have given it away. I have told that to my players. When the referee gives a penalty for nothing – it is a duel I think and you cannot decide who is worse – but we gave it away.” While Paul Dummett’s late Newcastle equaliser took a hefty deflection off Smalling, Steve McClaren arguably had considerably greater cause to be aggrieved by the refereeing and strongly disagreed with the early handball penalty awarded against Chancel Mbemba from which Rooney opened the scoring. Van Gaal gave credit to Newcastle’s approach. “Newcastle only wanted to attack,” he said. “You see two teams who want to attack. We saw a fantastic game tonight.” He added that normally it was different and his side were the victims of opposition spoiling tactics. “Only one team [Manchester United’s opponents] wants to waste time and frustrate opponents,” he claimed. Relieved to have ended a run of four defeats, McClaren’s mood was further buoyed by the completion of Jonjo Shelvey’s £12m transfer from Swansea City shortly before kickoff. McClaren said: “I think there’s a lot more to come from him.” The midfielder is expected to make his debut at home to West Ham United on Saturday. “I’m delighted to have signed Jonjo Shelvey,” he said. “I tried to sign him last summer. He’s English, he’s in the England team and I think there’s a lot more to come from him.” He feels much the same about his team as a whole. “Manchester United are a quality team but at the end of the night we’ve shown what we’re all about,” said McClaren. “We’ve shown character, attitude. By the end we actually had more possession that Manchester United.”\n"
