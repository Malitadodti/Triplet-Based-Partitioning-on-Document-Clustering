# Triplet-Based-Partitioning-on-Document-Clustering
Abstract :
Now-a-days information retrieval plays a large part of our everyday lives â€“ especially with the advent of the World Wide Web. During the last 
10 years, the amount of information available in various forms especially the data in textual format represented in newspapers, journals, magazines, 
books etc. has grown exponentially. However, this development has introduced problems of its own; finding useful information is increasingly becoming 
a hit-or-miss experience that often ends in information overload. In this thesis, we propose document clustering as a possible solution for improving 
information retrieval on the Web. The primary objective of this project was to do topic modelling in which a group of words related to a particular topic are 
grouped so that it becomes easy for the user to improve the information retrieval. To achieve this end, two clustering algorithms that are Non-Negative 
Matrix Factorization (NMF) which uses a matrix representation and Inverse Log Frequency and Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) which is based on a 
probabilistic approach to cluster the documents, were designed and implemented.
